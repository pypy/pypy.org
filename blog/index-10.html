    <p>In the last days I finally understood how to do virtualizables.  Now the frame overhead is gone. This was done with the help of discussion with Samuele, porting ideas from PyPy's first JIT attempt.
</p>
<p>
This is of course work in progress, but it works in PyPy (modulo a few XXXs, but no bugs so far).  The performance of the resulting code is quite good: even with Boehm (the GC that is easy to compile to but gives a slowish pypy-c), a long-running loop typically runs 50% faster than CPython.  That's "baseline" speed, moreover: we will get better speed-ups by applying optimizations on the generated code.  Doing so is in progress, but it suddenly became easier because that optimization phase no longer has to consider virtualizables -- they are now handled earlier.
</p>
<p><b>Update:</b>Virtualizables is basically a way to avoid frame overhead. The frame object
is allocated and has a pointer, but the JIT is free to unpack it's fields (for example python
level locals) and store them somewhere else (stack or registers). Each external (out of jit) access
to frame managed by jit, needs to go via special accessors that can ask jit where those variables
are.</p>

          <p>From what I understand virtualizables are objects that you use to represent objects that are expensive to construct. For example frame objects in python are very expensive so they are virtualizables and if a function is executed and it doesn't try to access its frame object it is never created.<br><br>Probably armin can give a more precise answer.<br><br>What I want to know, couldn't CPython have virtualizables for frame objects?

As usual, progress is going <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter's_law">slower then predicted</a>,
but nevertheless, we're working hard to make some progress.
</p>
<p>
We recently managed to make our nice GCs cooperate with our JIT. This is
one point from our detailed plan. As of now, we have a JIT with GCs and
no optimizations. It already speeds up some things, while slowing down
others. The main reason for this is that the JIT generates assembler which is kind
of ok, but it does not do the same level of optimizations gcc would do.
</p>
<p>
So the current status of the JIT is that it can produce assembler out
of executed python code (or any interpreter written in RPython actually),
but the results are not high quality enough since we're missing optimizations.
</p>
<p>
The current plan, as of now, looks as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Improve the handling of GCs in JIT with inlining of malloc-fast
  paths, that should speed up things by a constant, not too big factor.
</li>
<li>
Write a simplified python interpreter, which will be a base for experiments
  and to make sure that our JIT does correct things with regard to
  optimizations. That would work as mid-level integration test.
</li>
<li>
Think about ways to inline loop-less python functions into their parent's loop.
</li>
<li>
Get rid of frame overhead (by virtualizables)
</li>
<li>
Measure, write benchmarks, publish
</li>
<li>
Profit
</li>
</ul>

          <p>Unladen-Swallow's LLVM JIT is a very different beast: it compiles each Python function as a unit.  You can only get a uniform bit of speedup this way (maybe 2-3x).  By contrast, what we are doing gives a non-uniform speedup: like Psyco, we will probably obtain speedups between 2x and 100x depending on the use case.<br><br>(Of course the plan is to be faster than Psyco in the common case :-)</p>

          <p>Concerning current ideas vs April's roadmap: I understand that plans change and that's ok of course. But as April's roadmap isn't mentioned at all, I have no idea how the current ideas relate to the previous roadmap (like the current ideas replace the old road map or parts of it / they are additional ideas and the old roadmap is postponed / they are a detailing of (parts of) April's roadmap). Maybe that's obvious to people with better pypy-knowledge than me. I understand Armin's comment that they are additional ideas.<br><br>Keep up the good work!<br><br>Branko</p>

          <p>It does seem like an odd idea to trace the bytecode of an interpreter of the bytecode of a language, rather than just tracing the bytecode for a language. For example, it requires that you annotate the interpreter to retain information that you would otherwise naturally have, and it requires that you trace lots of extra bookkeeping code in the interpreter.<br><br>Given that you're writing a JIT that traces the execution of some bytecode, what advantages does tracing the outer bytecode have over tracing the inner bytecode? Is it that the outer bytecode is simpler than the inner bytecode; if so, is there no way to (inefficiently) compile the inner bytecode to the outer bytecode?</p>

          <p>John: The main reason for writing a JIT that traces the bytecode of the "outer" interpreter (which we call language interpreter in the paper) is that then we need to write only one tracing JIT in PyPy, and can use it for a variety of languages.<br><br>The tracing of the extra bookkeeping code is not a problem is not such a large problem, as the paper shows.

    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
So, according to our <a href="../posts/2009/04/roadmap-for-jit-377358891902851723.html">jit
plan</a> we're mostly done with point 1, that is to provide a JIT that compiles
python code to assembler in the most horrible manner possible but doesn't
break. That meant mostly 4 weeks of glaring at GDB and megabytess of assembler
generated by C code generated from python code. The figure of 4 weeks proves
that our approach is by far superior to the one of psyco, since Armin says it's
"only 4 weeks" :-)
</p>
<p>
Right now, pypy compiled with JIT can run the whole CPython test suite
without crashing, which means we're done with obvious bugs and the only
ones waiting for us are really horrible.  (Or they really don't exist.
At least they should never be about obscure Python corner cases: they can
only be in the 10'000 lines of relatively clear code that is our JIT
generator.)
</p>
<p>
But... the fun thing is that we can actually concentrate on optimizations!
So the next step is to provide a JIT that is correct *and* actually speeds
up python. Stay tuned for more :-)
</p>
Cheers,<br>
fijal, armin &amp; benjamin
<p>
UPDATE: for those of you blessed with no knowledge of C, gdb stands for GNU debugger, a classic debugger for C. (It's also much more powerful than python debugger, pdb, which is kind of surprising).</p>

          <p>Nice job guys! Once you announce that PyPy is pretty much of comparable (90% or better) speed to that of CPython then we will be happy to start running capacity tests of our web services environment on top of it and report back our results. <br><br>Given the growing number of python implementations has there ever been a discussion of PyPy replacing CPython as the canonical implementation of python once it consistently breaks performance &amp; reliability issues?

          <p>proteusguy: It is our hope that PyPy can one day replace CPython as the reference implementation, but this depends on many factors. Most of them are way out of our control. It will depend very much on the level of PyPy uptake in the community, but this is just a first step. With enough adoption, the Python developers (the people actually making new versions of CPython) need to be convinced that working from PyPy as a base to develop the language makes sense. If they are convinced, Guido may decide that it is a good idea and make the switch, but not before then.</p>

    <p>Hello.
</p>
<p>
First a disclaimer. This post is more about plans for future than current
status. We usually try to write about things that we have done, because
it's much much easier to promise things than to actually make it happen,
but I think it's important enough to have some sort of roadmap.
</p>
<p>
In recent months we came to the point where the 5th generation of
JIT prototype was working as <a href="../posts/2009/03/good-news-everyone-421421336094214242.html">nice</a>
or even a bit nicer than 1st one back in 2007. Someone might ask "so why
did you spend all this time without going forward?". And indeed, we spend
a lot of time moving sideways, but as posted, we also spent a lot of time
doing <a href="../posts/2009/04/beta-for-110-released-4604559533184706699.html">some other things</a>, which are important as well.
The main advantage of current JIT incarnation is much much simpler than
the first one. Even I can comprehend it, which is much of an improvement :-)
</p>
<p>
So, the prototype is working and gives very nice speedups in range of 20-30x
over CPython. We're pretty confident this prototype will work and will
produce fast python interpreter eventually. So we decided that now we'll
work towards changing prototype into something stable and solid. This
might sound easy, but in fact it's not. Having stable assembler backend
and optimizations that keep semantics is not as easy as it might sound.
</p>
<p>
The current roadmap, as I see it, looks like as following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Provide a JIT that does not speedup things, but produce assembler without
  optimizations turned on, that is correct and able to run CPython's library
  tests on a nightly basis.
</li>
<li>
 Introduce simple optimizations, that should make above JIT a bit faster than
  CPython. With optimizations disabled JIT is producing incredibly dumb
  assembler, which is slower than correspoding C code, even with removal
  of interpretation overhead (which is not very surprising).
</li>
<li>
 Backport optimizations from JIT prototype, one by one, keeping an eye
  on how they perform and making sure they don't break anything.
</li>
<li>
 Create new optimizations, like speeding up attribute access.
</li>
<li>
 Profit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This way, we can hopefully provide a working JIT, which gives fast python
interpreter, which is a bit harder than just a nice prototype.
</p>
<p>
Tell us what you think about this plan.
</p>
Cheers,<br>
fijal &amp; others.

          <p>I think it's a great idea. If the test suite succeeds on the basic JIT, it's much easier to spot regressions when you start adding the cool stuff. It also gives you a solid foundation to build on.<br><br>Good luck, this project is amazing :)</p>

          <p>Its not obvious from this post what would actually be the difference between the prototype and the final jit with all the prototypes optimisations. So ... it sounds like a lot of work for zero gain. I'm sure there is missing information, like what is actually missing from or wrong with the prototype ( is it in a different language? Prolog?)  Without this information its impossible to judge this plan.</p>

          <p>I'm extremely excited about seeing this happen. It is an unfortunate fact that the majority of people won't get PyPy until they see a 'big win'. Once they've noticed the big win they will start to see the 'hidden genius'. I'm glad that you are taking such a professional approach to this next phase and look forward to the day when people will start to look give PyPy the attention it deserves (if not for quite the right reason).</p>

          <p>herse: that's an approach which is often mentioned, but which does not make sense in PyPy.  The JIT is generated from the language spec; whether this spec covers 95% or 100% of Python doesn't change anything.  The 95%-versus-100% debate only makes sense at another level, e.g. if we wanted to make PyPy faster without a JIT at all.</p>

    <p>The Leysin sprint is nearing its end, as usual here is an attempt at a summary
</p>
<p>of what we did.</p>
<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/Se3dHMjUvrI/AAAAAAAAAHk/ZwGu2owTSok/s1600-h/landscape.jpg"><img alt="Beautiful Leysin Landscape" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5327157049947373234" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/Se3dHMjUvrI/AAAAAAAAAHk/ZwGu2owTSok/s320/landscape.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;"></a><div class="section" id="release-work">
<h2>Release Work</h2>
<p>Large parts of the sprint were dedicated to fixing bugs. Since the easy bugs
seem to have been fixed long ago, those were mostly very annoying and hard bugs.
This work was supported by our <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net:8099/">buildbots</a>, which we tried to get free of
test-failures. This was worked on by nearly all participants of the sprint
(Samuele, Armin, Anto, Niko, Anders, Christian, Carl Friedrich). One
particularly annoying bug was the differences in the tracing events that PyPy
produces (fixed by Anders, Samuele and Christian). Some details about larger
tasks are in the sections below.</p>
<p>The work culminated in the <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2009/04/beta-for-110-released-4604559533184706699.html">beta</a> released on Sunday.</p>
<div class="section" id="stackless">
<h3>Stackless</h3>
<p>A large number of problems came from our <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/stackless.html">stackless features</a>, which do some
advanced things and thus seem to contain advanced bugs. Samuele and Carl
Friedrich spent some time fixing tasklet pickling and unpickling. This was
achieved by supporting the (un)pickling of builtin code objects. In addition
they fixed some bugs in the finalization of tasklets. This needs some care
because the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__del__</span></tt> of a tasklet cannot run at arbitrary points in time, but
only at safe points. This problem was a bit subtle to get right, and popped up
nearly every morning of the sprint in form of a test failure.</p>
<p>Armin and Niko added a way to restrict the stack depth of the RPython-level
stack. This can useful when using stackless, because if this is not there it is
possible that you fill your whole heap with stack frames in the case of an
infinite recursion. Then they went on to make stackless not segfault when
threads are used at the same time, or if a callback from C library code is in
progress. Instead you get a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RuntimeError</span></tt> now, which is not good but better
than a segfault.</p>

</a><div class="section" id="killing-features">
<h3>Killing Features</h3>
<p>During the sprint we discussed the fate of the LLVM and the JS backends. Both
have not really been maintained for some time, and even partially untested
(their tests were skipped). Also their usefulness appears to be limited. The JS
backend is cool in principle, but has some serious limitations due to the fact
that JavaScript is really a dynamic language, while RPython is rather static.
This made it hard to use some features of JS from RPython, e.g. RPython does not
support closures of any kind.</p>
<p>The LLVM backend had its own set of problems. For
a long time it produced the fastest form of PyPy's Python interpreter, by first
using the LLVM backend, applying the LLVM optimizations to the result, then
using LLVM's C backend to produce C code, then apply GCC to the result :-).
However, it is not clear that it is still useful to directly produce LLVM
bitcode, since LLVM has rather good C frontends nowadays, with <a class="reference external" href="https://llvm.org/cmds/llvmgcc.html">llvm-gcc</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>. It is likely that we will use LLVM in the future in our JIT (but that's
another story, based on different code).</p>
<p>Therefore we decided to remove these two backends from SVN, which Samuele and
Carl Friedrich did. They are not dead, only resting until somebody who is
interested in maintaining them steps up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="windows">
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>One goal of the release is good Windows-support. Anders and Samuele set up a new
<a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net:8099/builders/pypy-c-lib-python-win-32">windows buildbot</a> which revealed a number of failures. Those were attacked by
Anders, Samuele and Christian as well as by Amaury (who was not at the sprint,
but thankfully did a lot of Windows work in the last months).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="os-x">
<h3>OS X</h3>
<p>Christian with some help by Samuele tried to get translation working again under
Mac OS X. This was a large mess, because of different behaviours of some POSIX
functionality in Leopard. It is still possible to get the old behaviour back,
but whether that was enabled or not depended on a number of factors such as
which Python is used. Eventually they managed to successfully navigate that maze
and produce something that almost works (there is still a problem remaining
about OpenSSL).</p>

<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>The Friday of the sprint was declared to be a documentation day, where (nearly)
no coding was allowed. This resulted in a newly structured and improved <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.html">getting
started</a> document (done by Carl Friedrich, Samuele and some help of Niko) and
a new document describing <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/cpython_differences.html">differences to CPython</a> (Armin, Carl Friedrich) as
well as various improvements to existing documents (everybody else). Armin
undertook the Sisyphean task of <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/extradoc.html">listing all talks, paper and related stuff</a>
of the PyPy project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="various-stuff">
<h2>Various Stuff</h2>
<div class="section" id="java-backend-work">
<h3>Java Backend Work</h3>
<p>Niko and Anto worked on the JVM backend for a while. First they had to fix
translation of the Python interpreter to Java. Then they tried to improve the
performance of the Python interpreter when translated to Java. Mostly they did a
lot of profiling to find performance bottlenecks. They managed to improve
performance by 40% by overriding <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fillInStackTrace</span></tt> of the generated exception
classes. Apart from that they found no simple-to-fix performance problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jit-work">
<h3>JIT Work</h3>
<p>Armin gave a presentation about the current state of the JIT to the sprinters as
well as Adrian Kuhn, Toon Verwaest and Camillo Bruni of the University of Bern
who came to visit for one day. There was a bit of work on the JIT going on too;
Armin and Anto tried to get closer to having a working JIT on top of the CLI.</p>

    <p>Today we are releasing a beta of the upcoming PyPy 1.1 release. There
are some Windows and OS X issues left that we would like to address
between now and the final release but apart from this things should be
working. We would appreciate feedback.</p>
<p>The PyPy development team.</p>
<div class="section" id="pypy-1-1-compatibility-consolidation">
<h2>PyPy 1.1: Compatibility &amp; Consolidation</h2>
<p>Welcome to the PyPy 1.1 release - the first release after the end of EU
funding. This release focuses on making PyPy's Python interpreter more
compatible with CPython (currently CPython 2.5) and on making the
interpreter more stable and bug-free.</p>
<p>PyPy's Getting Started lives at:</p>

<div class="section" id="highlights-of-this-release">
<h2>Highlights of This Release</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first">More of CPython's standard library extension modules are supported,
among them ctypes, sqlite3, csv, and many more. Most of these extension modules
are fully supported under Windows as well.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/cpython_differences.html">https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/cpython_differences.html</a>

</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Through a large number of tweaks, performance has been improved by
10%-50% since the 1.0 release. The Python interpreter is now between
0.8-2x (and in some corner case 3-4x) slower than CPython. A large
part of these speed-ups come from our new generational garbage
collectors.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/garbage_collection.html">https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/garbage_collection.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Our Python interpreter now supports distutils as well as
easy_install for pure-Python modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">We have tested PyPy with a number of third-party libraries. PyPy can
run now: Django, Pylons, BitTorrent, Twisted, SymPy, Pyglet, Nevow,
Pinax:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="first">A buildbot was set up to run the various tests that PyPy is using
nightly on Windows and Linux machines:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net:8099/">https://codespeak.net:8099/</a></p>

<h2>Other Changes</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first">The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">clr</span></tt> module was greatly improved. This module is used to
interface with .NET libraries when translating the Python
interpreter to the CLI.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/clr-module.html">https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/clr-module.html</a>

</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Stackless improvements: PyPy's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stackless</span></tt> module is now more
complete. We added channel preferences which change details of the
scheduling semantics. In addition, the pickling of tasklets has been
improved to work in more cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Classic classes are enabled by default now. In addition, they have
been greatly optimized and debugged:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="../posts/2007/12/faster-implementation-of-classic-1021557618590043616.html">https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2007/12/faster-implementation-of-classic.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">PyPy's Python interpreter can be translated to Java bytecode now to
produce a pypy-jvm. At the moment there is no integration with
Java libraries yet, so this is not really useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">We added cross-compilation machinery to our translation toolchain to
make it possible to cross-compile our Python interpreter to Nokia's
Maemo platform:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/maemo.html">https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/maemo.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Some effort was spent to make the Python interpreter more
memory-efficient. This includes the implementation of a mark-compact
GC which uses less memory than other GCs during collection.
Additionally there were various optimizations that make Python
objects smaller, e.g. class instances are often only 50% of the size
of CPython.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="../posts/2008/10/dsseldorf-sprint-report-days-1-3-5256639868851086032.html">https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2008/10/dsseldorf-sprint-report-days-1-3.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The support for the trace hook in the Python interpreter was
improved to be able to trace the execution of builtin functions and
methods. With this, we implemented the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_lsprof</span></tt> module, which is
the core of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cProfile</span></tt> module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">A number of rarely used features of PyPy were removed since the previous
release because they were unmaintained and/or buggy. Those are: The
LLVM and the JS backends, the aspect-oriented programming features,
the logic object space, the extension compiler and the first
incarnation of the JIT generator. The new JIT generator is in active
development, but not included in the release.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h2>What is PyPy?</h2>
<p>Technically, PyPy is both a Python interpreter implementation and an
advanced compiler, or more precisely a framework for implementing dynamic
languages and generating virtual machines for them.</p>
<p>The framework allows for alternative frontends and for alternative
backends, currently C, Java and .NET.  For our main target "C", we can
"mix in" different garbage collectors and threading models,
including micro-threads aka "Stackless".  The inherent complexity that
arises from this ambitious approach is mostly kept away from the Python
interpreter implementation, our main frontend.</p>
<p>Socially, PyPy is a collaborative effort of many individuals working
together in a distributed and sprint-driven way since 2003.  PyPy would
not have gotten as far as it has without the coding, feedback and
general support from numerous people.</p>

          <p>PyPy without jit can (and is sometimes) be faster than cpython, for various reasons, including garbage collector.<br><br>On the other hand, we rather won't sacrifice simplicity for speed and we hope that jit will go that part.

          <p>Maciej, I know how hard you are working on this. I didn't mean to sound disrespectful and I don't want to bother you... It's just that as everyone else, I'm anxoiusly looking forward to seeing pypy's magic in action. By the way, the new post is very much appreciated. Thanks!</p>

    <p>The Leysin Sprint started today. The weather is great and the view is wonderful, as usual. Technically we are working on the <a href="https://codespeak.net:8099/summary">remaining test failures</a> of the nightly test runs and are generally trying to fix various long-postponed bugs. I will try to give more detailed reports as the sprint progresses.</p>

    <p>Hi.
</p>
<p>
We didn't yet write full pycon summary, but both of our talks are now online: <a href="https://blip.tv/file/1957282">PyPy status talk</a> and <a href="https://blip.tv/file/1956957">python in a sandbox</a>.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b></p>
<p>Slides are also available: <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/pycon2009/status/status.pdf">PyPy status talk</a> and <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/pycon2009/pypy-sandbox/sandbox.pdf">Python in a sandbox</a>.</p>
