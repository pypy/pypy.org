<p>Hello.</p>
<p>During the PyCon trip multiple people asked me how exactly they could run
their stuff on PyPy to get the speedups. Now, in an ideal world,
you would just swap CPython with PyPy, everything would run tons of times
faster and everyone would live happily ever after. However, we don't live in
an ideal world and PyPy does not speed up <em>everything</em> you could
potentially run. Chances are that you can run your stuff quite a bit faster, but
it requires quite a bit more R&amp;D than just that. This blog post is an attempt to
explain certain steps that might help. So here we go:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Download and install PyPy. 2.0 beta 1 or upcoming 2.0 beta 2 would be a good
candidate; it's not called a beta for stability reasons.</li>
<li>Run your tests on PyPy. There is absolutely no need for fast software that
does not work. There might be some failures. Usually they're harmless (e.g.
you forgot to close the file); either fix them or at least inspect them. In
short, make sure stuff works.</li>
<li>Inspect your stack. In particular, C extensions, while sometimes working, are
a potential source of instability and slowness. Fortunately,
since the introduction of <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org">cffi</a>, the ecosystem of PyPy-compatible software
has been growing. Things I know are written with PyPy in mind:<ul>
<li>the new version of <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl">pyOpenSSL</a> will support PyPy via cffi</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chtd/psycopg2cffi">psycopg2cffi</a> is the most actively maintained postgres binding for PyPy,
with pg8000 reported working</li>
<li>mysql has a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/quora/mysql-ctypes">ctypes based implementation</a> (although a cffi-based one would
be definitely better)</li>
<li>PyPy 2.0 beta 2 will come with sqlite-using-cffi</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/amauryfa/lxml/tree/lxml-cffi">lxml-cffi</a></li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi-docs">uWSGI</a>, while working, is almost certainly not the best choice. Try
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">tornado</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedWeb">twisted.web</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://cyclone.io/">cyclone.io</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://gunicorn.org/">gunicorn</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gevent.org/">gevent</a>
(note: gevent support for PyPy is not quite finished; will write about it
in a separate blog post, but you can't just use the main branch of gevent)</li>
<li>consult (and contribute to) <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/Home">pypy compatibility wiki</a> for details (note
that it's community maintained, might be out of date)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Have benchmarks. If you don't have benchmarks, then performance does not
matter for you. Since PyPy's warm-up time is bad (and yes, we know, we're
working on it), you should leave ample time for warm-ups. Five to ten seconds
of continuous computation should be enough.</li>
<li>Try them. If you get lucky, the next step might be to deploy and be happy.
If you're unlucky, profile and try to isolate bottlenecks. They might be in
a specific library or they might be in your code. The better you can isolate
them, the higher your chances of understanding what's going on.</li>
<li>Don't take it for granted. PyPy's JIT is very good, but there is a variety
of reasons that it might not work how you expect it to. A lot of times it
starts off slow, but a little optimization can improve the speed as much as
10x. Since PyPy's runtime is less mature than CPython, there are higher
chances of finding an obscure corner of the standard library that might be
atrociously slow.</li>
<li>Most importantly, if you run out of options and you have a reproducible
example, <strong>please report it</strong>. A <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">pypy-dev</a> email, popping into <tt class="docutils literal">#pypy</tt>
on <tt class="docutils literal">irc.freenode.net</tt>, or getting hold of me on twitter are good ways.
You can also contact me directly at <em>fijall at gmail.com</em> as well. While
it's cool if the example is slow, a lot of problems only show up on large
and convoluted examples. As long as I can reproduce it on my machine or I can
log in somewhere, I am usually happy to help.</li>
<li>I typically use a combination of <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/jitviewer">jitviewer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/default/rpython/tool/lsprofcalltree.py?at=default">lsprofcalltree</a> to try to guess what's going on. These tools are all
useful, but use them with care. They usually require quite a bit of
understanding before being useful. Also sometimes they're just plain useless
and you need to write your own analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this summary of steps to take is useful. We hear a lot of stories
of people trying PyPy, most of them positive, but some of them negative.
If you just post "PyPy didn't work for me" on your blog, that's
cool too, but you're missing an opportunity. The reasons may vary from
something serious like "this is a bad pattern for PyPy GC" to something
completely hilarious like "oh, I left this <tt class="docutils literal">sys._getframe()</tt> somewhere
in my hot loops for debugging" or "I used the <tt class="docutils literal">logging</tt> module which uses
<tt class="docutils literal">sys._getframe()</tt> all over  the place".</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

          <p>As the main uWSGI author i can only confirm the post. Embedding pypy in c applications (not the inverse) is still hacky, and afaik uWSGi is the only project trying to do it. So albeit the combo works, it is only a proof of concept that require still lot of effort (both from pypy and uWSGI) to be production-ready.</p>

<p>Hello, some good news!</p>
<p>First the update:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<strong>dtype support</strong> - NumPy on PyPy now supports non-native storage formats.
Due to a lack of true support for longdoubles in rpython, we decided to back
out the support of longdouble-as-double which was misleading.</li>
<li>
<strong>missing ndarray attributes</strong> - work has been made toward supporting the
complete set of attributes
on ndarrays. We are progressing alphabetically, and have made it to d.
Unsupported attributes, and unsupported arguments to attribute calls
will raise a NotImplementedError.</li>
<li>
<strong>pickling support for numarray</strong> - hasn't started yet, but next on the list</li>
<li>There has been some work on exposing <strong>FFI routines</strong> in numpypy.</li>
<li>Brian Kearns has made progress in improving the <strong>numpypy namespace</strong>.
The python numpypy submodules now more closely resemble their numpy
counterparts. Also, translated _numpypy submodules are now more properly
mapped to the numpy core c-based submodules, furthering the goal of being
able to install numpy as a pure-python module with few modifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now the good news:</p>
<p>While our funding drive over 2012 did not reach our goal, we still managed to
raise a fair amount of money in donations. So far we only managed to spend around $10 000 of it.
We issued a call for additional developers, and are glad to welcome Romain Guillebert and Ronan Lamy
to the numpypy team. Hopefully we will be able to report on speedier progress soon.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Matti Picus, Maciej Fijalkowski</p>

          <p>Regarding long double, that's clearly something you should not waste your time on. I think the way it was implemented in numpy is not good, and I generally advise against it (the only real use I can see is if you need to interoperate with binary formats that use it, but even there, the complete platform specificity of it is a killer).</p>

    <p>This is the tenth status update about our work on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/all/tip/branch%28%22py3k%22%29">py3k branch</a>, which we<br>
can work on thanks to all of the people who <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2012/01/py3k-and-numpy-first-stage-thanks-to-3008917396290059758.html">donated</a> to the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/py3donate.html">py3k proposal</a>.</p>
<p>There's been significant progress since the last update: the <a class="reference external" href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/summary?branch=py3k">linux x86-32<br>
buildbot</a> now passes 289 out of approximately 354 modules (with 39 skips) of<br>
CPython's regression test suite.</p>
<p>That means there's only 26 test module failures left! The list of major items<br>
remaining for 3.2 compatibility are now short enough to list here, with their<br>
related tests:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tokenizer support for non-ascii identifiers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><ul class="simple">
<li>test_importlib</li>
<li>test_pep263</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>memoryview (Manuel Jacob's tackling this on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/compare/py3k-memoryview..py3k">py3k-memoryview branch</a>)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><ul class="simple">
<li>test_memoryview</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>multiprocessing module currently deadlocks</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><ul class="simple">
<li>test_multiprocessing</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Buggy handling of the new extended unpacking syntax by the compiler:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><ul class="simple">
<li>test_unpack_ex</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The new Global Interpreter Lock and new thread signal handling</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><ul class="simple">
<li>test_threading</li>
<li>test_threadsignals</li>
<li>test_sys</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Upgrade unicodedata to 6.0.0 (requires updates to the actual unicodedata<br>
generation script)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><ul class="simple">
<li>test_ucn</li>
<li>test_unicode</li>
<li>test_unicodedata</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="../posts/2010/04/using-cpython-extension-modules-with-5864754772659599217.html">CPyExt</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><ul class="simple">
<li>test_capi (currently crashes)</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Update int's hash code to match to CPython (float's is already updated on the<br><a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/compare/py3k-newhash..py3k">py3k-newhash branch</a>. note that PyPy 2.x doesn't even totally match<br>
CPython's hashing)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><ul class="simple">
<li>test_decimal</li>
<li>test_fractions</li>
<li>test_numeric_tower</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Miscellaneous:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><ul class="simple">
<li>test_complex</li>
<li>test_float</li>
<li>test_peepholer</li>
<li>test_range</li>
<li>test_sqlite (a new cffi based version seems to be coming)</li>
<li>test_ssl</li>
<li>test_struct</li>
<li>test_subprocess</li>
<li>test_sys_settrace</li>
<li>test_time</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Additionally there are still a number of failures in PyPy's internal test<br>
suite. These tests are usually ran against untranslated versions of PyPy during<br>
development. However we've now began running them against a fully translated<br>
version of PyPy on the buildbot too (thanks to Amaury for setting this<br>
up). This further ensures that our tests and implementation are sane.</p>
<p>We're getting closer to producing an initial alpha release. Before that happens<br>
we'd like to see:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>further test fixes</li>
<li>the results of test runs on other major platforms (e.g. linux x86-64 and osx<br>
seem to have some additional failures as of now)</li>
<li>some basic real world testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally I'd like to thank Manuel Jacob for his various contributions over the<br>
past month, including fixing the array and ctypes modules among other things,<br>
and also Amaury Forgeot d'Arc for his ongoing excellent contributions.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>
Phil</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">From a software engineering perspective, 10 years is indistinguishable
from infinity, so I don't care what happens 10 years from now -- as
long as you don't blame me. :-)</p> - Guido van Rossum, Python creator.
<p>10 years is indeed a long time. PyPy was created approximately 10 years ago,
with the exact date being lost in the annals of the version control system.
We've come a long way during those 10 years, from a "minimal Python" that
was supposed to serve mostly as an educational tool, through to a vehicle for
academic research to a high performance VM for Python and beyond.</p>
<p>Some facts from the PyPy timeline:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In 2007, at the end of the EU funding period, we promised the JIT was just around the corner.
It turned out we misjudged it pretty badly -- the first usable PyPy was released in 2010.</li>
<li>At some point we decided to have a JavaScript backend so one could compile RPython programs
to JavaScript and run them in a browser. Turned out it was a horrible idea.</li>
<li>Another option we tried was using RPython to write CPython C extensions. Again, it turned out RPython
is a bad language and instead we made a fast JIT, so you don't have to write C extensions.</li>
<li>We made N attempts to use LLVM.  Seriously, N is 4 or 5.  But we haven't fully given up yet :-)
They all run into issues one way or another.</li>
<li>We were huge fans of ctypes at the beginning. Up to the point where we tried to make
a restricted subset with static types, called rctypes for RPython. Turned out to be horrible.
Twice.</li>
<li>We were very hopeful about creating a JIT generator from the beginning. But the first one failed miserably,
generating too much assembler. The second failed too. The third first burned down and then failed.
However, we managed to release a working JIT in 2010, against all odds.</li>
<li>Martijn Faassen used to ask us "how fast is PyPy" so we decided to name an option enabling all
optimizations "--faassen".  Then "--no-faassen" was naturally added too. Later we
decided to grow up and renamed it to "-O2", and now "-Ojit".</li>
<li>The first time the Python interpreter successfully compiled to C, it segfaulted because the code generator used signed chars instead of unsigned chars...</li>
<li>To make it more likely to be accepted, the proposal for the EU project contained basically every feature under the sun a language could have. This proved to be annoying, because we had to actually implement all that stuff. Then we had to do a cleanup sprint where we deleted 30% of codebase and 70% of features.</li>
<li>At one sprint someone proposed a new software development methodology: 'Terminology-Driven Programming' means to pick a fancy name, then discuss what it could mean, then implement it. Examples: timeshifter, rainbow interpreter, meta-space bubble, hint annotations (all but one of these really existed).</li>
<li>There is a conspiracy theory that the reason why translation is so slow is because time is stored away during it, which is later retrieved when an actual program runs to make them appear faster</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it was a really long road.  However, 10 years later we are in
good shape.  A quick look on the immediate future: we are approaching
PyPy 2.0 with stackless+JIT and cffi support,
the support for Python 3 is taking shape, non-standard
extensions like STM are slowly getting ready (more soon), and there are
several non-Python interpreters around the corner (Hippy, Topaz and more).</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
fijal, arigo, hodgestar, cfbolz and the entire pypy team.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cppyy.html">cppyy module</a>
provides C++ bindings for PyPy by using the reflection information extracted
from C++ header files by means of the
<a href="https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/reflex">Reflex package</a>.
In order to support C++11, the goal is to move away from Reflex and instead use
<a href="https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cling">cling</a>, an interactive
C++ interpreter, as the backend.
Cling is based on <a href="https://llvm.org/">llvm</a>'s
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>.

The use of a real compiler under the hood has the advantage that it is now
possible to cover every conceivable corner case.
The disadvantage, however, is that every corner case actually has to be
covered.
Life is somewhat easier when calls come in from the python interpreter, as
those calls have already been vetted for syntax errors and all lookups are
well scoped.
Furthermore, the real hard work of getting sane responses from and for C++
in an interactive environment is done in cling, not in the bindings.
Nevertheless, it is proving a long road (but for that matter clang does not
support all of C++11 yet), so here's a quick status update showing that good 
progress is being made.

</p>
<p>The following example is on CPython, not PyPy, but moving a third
(after Reflex and
<a href="https://root.cern.ch/root/Cint.html">CINT</a>) backend into place
underneath cppyy is straightforward compared to developing the backend
in the first place.

Take this snippet of C++11 code
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cpp11.C</span></tt>):

</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    constexpr int data_size() { return 5; }

    auto N = data_size();

    template&lt;class L, class R&gt;
    struct MyMath {
       static auto add(L l, R r) -&gt; decltype(l+r) { return l + r; }
    };

    template class MyMath&lt;int, int&gt;;</pre>

<p>As a practical matter, most usage of new C++11 features will live in
implementations, not in declarations, and are thus never seen by the bindings.
The above example is therefore somewhat contrived, but it will serve to show
that these new declarations actually work.
The new features used here are
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">constexpr</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto</span></tt>, and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">decltype</span></tt>.
Here is how you could use these from CPython, using the
<a href="https://root.cern.ch/viewvc/trunk/bindings/pyroot/">PyROOT</a>
package, which has more than a passing resemblance to cppyy, as one is based
on the other:

</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    import ROOT as gbl
    gbl.gROOT.LoadMacro('cpp11.C')

    print 'N =', gbl.N
    print '1+1 =', gbl.MyMath(int, int).add(1,1)</pre>

which, when entered into a file
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cpp11.py</span></tt>) and executed,
prints the expected results:

<p></p>
<pre>    $ python cpp11.py
    N = 5
    1+1 = 2</pre>

In the example, the C++ code is compiled on-the-fly, rather than first generating
a dictionary as is needed with Reflex.
A deployment model that utilizes stored pre-compiled information is foreseen
to work with larger projects, which may have to pull in headers from many places.

<p>Work is going to continue first on C++03 on cling with CPython (about 85% of
unit tests currently pass), with a bit of work on C++11 support on the side.
Once fully in place, it can be brought into a new backend for cppyy, after 
which the remaining parts of C++11 can be fleshed out for both interpreters.

          <p>Right now, there are no PyPy objects exposed as such, but only PyObjects through cpyext in support of the python C-API. In cppyy, cpyext is used for any interface that has a PyObject* as argument or return value. It is cpyext that takes care of marrying the ref-count API with the garbage collector.<br><br>Don't pin me down on the details, but from what I understand of cpyext, a wrapper object with the proper C layout is created, and given a life line by putting it in an internal container holding all such objects safe from the gc simply by existing. When the ref count hits zero, the life line gets removed. Object identity is preserved by finding objects in the internal container and reusing them.</p>

    <p>Hello everyone</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/">Alex Gaynor</a> announced the first public release of
<a href="https://topaz.readthedocs.org/en/latest/blog/announcing-topaz/">Topaz</a>,
a Ruby interpreter written in RPython. This is the culmination of a
part-time effort over the past 10 months to provide a Ruby interpreter
that implements enough interesting constructs in Ruby to show that the
RPython toolchain can produce a Ruby implementation fast enough to
beat what is out there.</p>

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>

<p>Obviously the implementation is very incomplete currently in terms of
available standard library. We are working on getting it useable. If
you want to try it, grab a
<a href="https://topazruby.com/builds/">nightly build</a>.</p>

<p>We have run some benchmarks from the
<a href="https://github.com/acangiano/ruby-benchmark-suite">Ruby benchmark suite</a>
and the
<a href="https://github.com/ltratt/metatracing_vms_experiment">metatracing VMs experiment</a>. The
preliminary results are promising, but at this point we are missing so
many method implementations that most benchmarks won't run yet. So instead of
performance, I'm going to talk about the high-level structure of the
implementation.</p>

<h4>Architecture</h4>

<p>Topaz interprets a custom bytecode set. The basics are similar to
Smalltalk VMs, with bytecodes for loading and storing locals and
instance variables, sending messages, and stack management. Some
syntactical features of Ruby, such as defining classes and modules,
literal regular expressions, hashes, ranges, etc also have their own
bytecodes. The third kind of bytecodes are for control flow constructs
in Ruby, such as loops, exception handling, break, continue, etc.</p>

<p>In trying to get from Ruby source code to bytecode, we found that the
easiest way to support all of the Ruby syntax is to write a custom
lexer and use an RPython port of <a href="https://github.com/dabeaz/ply">PLY</a>
(fittingly called <a href="https://github.com/alex/rply">RPly</a>) to create the
parser from the Ruby yacc grammar.</p>

<p>The Topaz interpreter uses an <code>ObjectSpace</code> (similar to how PyPy does
it), to interact with the Ruby world. The object space contains all
the logic for wrapping and interacting with Ruby objects from the
VM. It's <code>__init__</code> method sets up the core classes, initial globals,
and creates the main thread (the only one right now, as we do not have
threading, yet).</p>

<p>Classes are mostly written in Python. We use ClassDef objects to
define the Ruby hierarchy and attach RPython methods to Ruby via
ClassDef decorators. These two points warrant a little explanation.</p>

<h5>Hierarchies</h5>

<p>All Ruby classes ultimately inherit from <code>BasicObject</code>. However, most
objects are below <code>Object</code> (which is a direct subclass of
<code>BasicObject</code>). This includes objects of type <code>Fixnum</code>, <code>Float</code>,
<code>Class</code>, and <code>Module</code>, which may not need all of the facilities of
full objects most of the time.</p>

<p>Most VMs treat such objects specially, using tagged pointers to
represent Fixnums, for example. Other VMs (for example from the
<a href="https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/projects/som/index.html#overview">SOM Family</a>)
don't. In the latter case, the implementation hierarchy matches the
language hierarchy, which means that objects like Fixnum share a
representation with all other objects (e.g. they have class pointers
and some kind of instance variable storage).</p>

<p>In Topaz, implementation hierarchy and language hierarchy are
separate. The first is defined through the Python inheritance. The
other is defined through the ClassDef for each Python class, where the
appropriate Ruby superclass is chosen. The diagram below shows how the
implementation class <code>W_FixnumObject</code> inherits directly from
<code>W_RootObject</code>.  Note that <code>W_RootObject</code> doesn't have any attrs,
specifically no storage for instance variables and no map (for
determining the class - we'll get to that). These attributes are
instead defined on <code>W_Object</code>, which is what most other implementation
classes inherit from. However, on the Ruby side, Fixnum correctly
inherits (via <code>Numeric</code> and <code>Integer</code>) from <code>Object</code>.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i-L-NdwW7I0/URpqZK9u8VI/AAAAAAAACJM/jseKbfD_wEw/s1600/Topaz-Parallel-Hierarchies.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="384" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i-L-NdwW7I0/URpqZK9u8VI/AAAAAAAACJM/jseKbfD_wEw/s400/Topaz-Parallel-Hierarchies.png" width="305"></a>
</div>

<p>This simple structural optimization gives a huge speed boost, but
there are VMs out there that do not have it and suffer performance
hits for it.</p>

<h5>Decorators</h5>

<p>Ruby methods can have symbols in its names that are not allowed as
part of Python method names, for example <strong>!</strong>, <strong>?</strong>, or <strong>=</strong>, so we
cannot simply define Python methods and expose them to Ruby by the
same name. </p>

<p>For defining the Ruby method name of a function, as well as argument
number checking, Ruby type coercion and unwrapping of Ruby objects to
their Python equivalents, we use decorators defined on ClassDef. When
the ObjectSpace initializes, it builds all Ruby classes from their
respective ClassDef objects. For each method in an implementation
class that has a ClassDef decorator, a wrapper method is generated and
exposed to Ruby. These wrappers define the name of the Ruby method,
coerce Ruby arguments, and unwrap them for the Python method.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>@classdef.method("*", times="int")
def method_times(self, space, times):
    return self.strategy.mul(space, self.str_storage, times)
</code></pre>

<p>This defines the method <code>*</code> on the Ruby String class. When this is
called, the first argument is converted into a Ruby Fixnum object
using the appropriate coercion method, and then unwrapped into a plain
Python int and passed as argument to <code>method_times</code>. The wrapper
method also supplies the space argument.</p>

<h4>Object Structure</h4>

<p>Ruby objects have dynamically defined instance variables and may
change their class at any time in the program (a concept called
<a href="https://ola-bini.blogspot.de/2006/09/ruby-singleton-class.html">singleton class</a>
in Ruby - it allows each object to have unique behaviour). To still
efficiently access instance variables, you want to avoid dictionary
lookups and let the JIT know about objects of the same class that have
the same instance variables. Topaz, like PyPy (which got it from
Self), implements instances using maps, which transforms dictionary
lookups into array accesses. See the
<a href="../posts/2010/11/efficiently-implementing-python-objects-3838329944323946932.html">blog post</a>
for the details.</p>

<p>This is only a rough overview of the architecture. If you're

    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>A short notice to tell you that <a href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org/">CFFI 0.5</a> was released.  This
contains a number of small improvements from 0.4, but seems to otherwise
be quite stable since a couple of months --- no change since January 10,
apart from the usual last-minute fixes for Python 3 and for Windows.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Proposed herein is a part-time fellowship for developing NumPy in PyPy.
The work will initially consist of 100 hours
with the possibility of extension, until the funds run out.
Development and improvement of PyPy's NumPyPy (as
with most Open Source and Free Software) is done as a collaborative process
between volunteer, paid, and academic contributors. Due to a successful funding
drive but a lack of contributors willing to work directly for PyPy, we find
ourselves in the enviable situation of being able to offer this position.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>PyPy's developers make all PyPy software available to the public
without charge, under PyPy's Open Source copyright license, the
permissive MIT License. PyPy's license assures that PyPy is equally
available to everyone freely on terms that allow both non-commercial
and commercial activity. This license allows for academics, for-profit
software developers, volunteers and enthusiasts alike to collaborate
together to make a better Python implementation for everyone.</p>
<p>NumPy support for PyPy is licensed similarly, and therefore NumPy in
PyPy support can directly help researchers and developers who seek to
do numeric computing but want an easier programming language to use
than Fortan or C, which is typically used for these
applications. Being licensed freely to the general public means that
opportunities to use, improve and learn about how NumPy in PyPy works
itself will be generally available to everyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-need-for-a-part-time-developer">
<h3>The Need for a Part-Time Developer</h3>
<p>NumPy project in PyPy has seen some slow, but steady progress since we started
working about a year ago.  On one hand,
it's actually impressive what we could deliver with the effort undertaken,
on the other hand, we would like to see the development accelerated.</p>
<p>PyPy has strict coding, testing, documentation, and review standards,
which ensures excellent code quality, continually improving
documentation and code test coverage, and minimal regressions. A
part-time developer will be able to bring us closer to the goal of
full numpy-api implementation and speed improvements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="work-plan">
<h3>Work Plan</h3>
<p>The current proposal is split into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Compatibility</strong>:</p>
<p>This part covers the core NumPy Python API. We'll implement most NumPy APIs
that are officially documented and we'll pass most of NumPy's tests that
cover documented APIs and are not implementation details.
Specifically, we don't plan to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>implement NumPy's C API</li>
<li>implement other scientific libraries, like SciPy, matplotlib or biopython</li>
<li>implement details that are otherwise agreed by consensus to not have a place
in PyPy's implementation of NumPy or agreed with NumPy community
to be implementation details</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Speed</strong>:</p>
<p>This part will cover significant speed improvements in the JIT that would
make numeric computations faster. This includes, but is not necesarilly
limited to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>write a set of benchmarks covering various use cases</li>
<li>teaching the JIT backend (or multiple backends) how to deal with vector
operations, like SSE</li>
<li>experiments with automatic parallelization using multiple threads, akin
to numexpr</li>
<li>improving the JIT register allocator that will make a difference, especially
for tight loops</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all speed improvements, it's relatively hard to predict exactly
how it'll cope, however we expect the results to be withing an order
of magnitude of handwritten C equivalent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="position-candidate">
<h3>Position Candidate</h3>
<p>We would like people who are proficient in NumPy and PyPy (but don't have to be
core developers of either) to step up. The developer selection will be done
by consensus of PyPy core developers and consulted with the Software Freedom
Conservancy for lack of conflict of interest. The main criterium will be
past contributions to the PyPy project, but they don't have to be significant
in size.</p>
<p>A candidate for the Developer position will demonstrate the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The ability to write clear, stable, suitable and tested code</li>
<li>The ability to understand and extend the JIT capabilities used in NumPyPy.</li>
<li>A positive presence in PyPy's online community on IRC and the mailing
list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally the Developer will also:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Have familiarity with the infrastructure of the PyPy project (including
bug tracker and buildbot).</li>
<li>Have Worked to provide education or outreach on PyPy in other forums such as
workshops, conferences, and user groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conservancy and PyPy are excited to announce the Developer Position.
Renumeration for the position will be at the rate of 60 USD per hour, through
the Software Freedom Conservancy.</p>
<p>PyPy community is promising to provide necessary guidance and help into
the current codebase, however we expect a successful candidate to be able
to review code and incorporate external patches within two months of the
starting date of the contract.</p>
<p>Candidates should submit their proposal (including their CV) to:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="mailto:pypy-z@python.org">pypy-z@python.org</a></p>
<p>The deadline for this initial round of proposals is February 1, 2013.</p>

          <p>It's been said before but as a long time NumPy and SciPy user, please please please don't call this project NumPy. It's great for PyPy to have an nd-array lib and for sure NumPy has some of the best semantics and user API for that so by all means make it compatible, but giving it the same name just makes tremendous confusion for users. For scientific users without the C-API which allows most of the widely used scientific extensions it is simply not "numpy".</p>

          <p>I am following each of your announcements with great interest.<br>JIT optimization of array manipulations would enormously benefit my daily work.<br><br>Even though I am trying hard to follow the discussion, I have difficulty understanding the issues at hand, and what numpypy is going to be when it is finished. <br><br>Probably I am not the only one, considering the sometimes controversial discussion.<br><br>My current understanding is this:<br>All python code in numpy will run much better under pypy.<br><br>The problem are the external libraries. Depending on the type, there will be different approaches.<br><br>I assume that you will re-write a large part of the c-part of numpy directly in python, and then make use of the JIT optimizer. That would be the approach for all of the algorithms that are currently written in c, but could be easily re-implemented in python.<br>Something like ufunc_object.c could probably be rewritten in python without a loss of speed. <br>Of course, even though this would still run under normal python, it would be far to slow.<br><br>Then you have external dlls, like BLAS. I assume you will call them differently (ctypes?), and not as extension modules. If you use ctypes, it will still run under normal python, maybe a bit slower.<br><br>Then you have parts that are currently written in c, but that you can neither re-implement in python, nor call as a dll. Will you re-write those in c, using a different c-api? Or re-write them, so that they can be called using ctypes?<br><br><br>Maybe you give a short general overview about the issues with the c-api and what you are doing?<br><br>Something like. "Currently the function numpy.dot is written as a c-extension. It makes extensive use of PyArray_GETITEM. This limits the optimizer.

<p>Just a very short update on December's work: we're now passing about 223 of<br>
approximately 355 modules of CPython's regression test suite, up from passing<br>
194 last month.</p>
<p>Some brief highlights:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>More encoding related issues were addressed. e.g. now most if not all the<br>
multibytecodec test modules pass.</li>
<li>Fixed some path handling issues (<tt class="docutils literal">test_os</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">test_ntpath</tt> and<br><tt class="docutils literal">test_posixpath</tt> now pass)</li>
<li>We now pass <tt class="docutils literal">test_class</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">test_descr</tt> and almost <tt class="docutils literal">test_builtin</tt> (among<br>
other things): these are notable as they are fairly extensive test suites of<br>
core aspects of the langauge.</li>
