    <section id="pypy-v7-3-5-release-of-2-7-and-3-7"><h2>PyPy v7.3.5: release of 2.7 and 3.7</h2>
<p>We are releasing a PyPy 7.3.5 with bugfixes for PyPy 7.3.4, released April 4.
PyPy 7.3.4 was the first release that runs on windows 64-bit, so that support
is still "beta". We are releasing it in the hopes that we can garner momentum
for its continued support, but are already aware of some problems, for instance
it errors in the NumPy test suite (issue <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3462">3462</a>). Please help out with testing
the release and reporting successes and failures, financially supporting our
ongoing work, and helping us find the source of these problems.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The new windows 64-bit builds improperly named c-extension modules
with the same extension as the 32-bit build (issue <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3443">3443</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the windows-specific <code class="docutils literal">PC/pyconfig.h</code> rather than the posix one</p></li>
<li><p>Fix the return type for <code class="docutils literal">_Py_HashDouble</code> which impacts 64-bit windows</p></li>
<li><p>A change to the python 3.7 <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sysconfig.get_config_var('LIBDIR')</span></code> was wrong,
leading to problems finding <cite>libpypy3-c.so</cite> for embedded PyPy (issue <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3442">3442</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Instantiate <code class="docutils literal">distutils.command.install</code> schema for PyPy-specific
<code class="docutils literal">implementation_lower</code></p></li>
<li><p>Delay thread-checking logic in greenlets until the thread is actually started
(continuation of issue <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3441">3441</a>)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Four upstream (CPython) security patches were applied:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue42988">BPO 42988</a> to remove <code class="docutils literal">pydoc.getfile</code></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue43285">BPO 43285</a> to not trust the <code class="docutils literal">PASV</code> response in <code class="docutils literal">ftplib</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue43075">BPO 43075</a> to remove a possible ReDoS in <code class="docutils literal">urllib</code> <code class="docutils literal">AbstractBasicAuthHandler</code></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue43882">BPO 43882</a> to sanitize urls containing ASCII newline and tabs in
<code class="docutils literal">urllib.parse</code></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fix for json-specialized dicts (issue <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3460">3460</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Specialize <code class="docutils literal">ByteBuffer.setslice</code> which speeds up binary file reading by a
factor of 3</p></li>
<li><p>When assigning the full slice of a list, evaluate the rhs before clearing the
list (issue <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3440">3440</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>On Python2, <code class="docutils literal">PyUnicode_Contains</code> accepts bytes as well as unicode.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish fixing <code class="docutils literal">_sqlite3</code> - untested <code class="docutils literal">_reset()</code> was missing an argument
(issue <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3432">3432</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Update the packaged sqlite3 to 3.35.5 on windows. While not a bugfix, this
seems like an easy win.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend updating. These fixes are the direct result of end-user bug
reports, so please continue reporting issues as they crop up.</p>

<p>We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear about
it and encourage submissions to our <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/blog">renovated blog site</a> via a pull request
to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org">https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org</a></p>
<p>We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on PyPy, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython's JIT even better.</p>
<p>If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io">CFFI</a> / <a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io">cppyy</a> version of your library that would be performant on PyPy.
In any case both <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel">cibuildwheel</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild">multibuild system</a> support
building wheels for PyPy.</p>
<section id="what-is-pypy"><h3>What is PyPy?</h3>
<p>PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.7, and
soon 3.8. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">PyPy and CPython 3.7.4</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.</p>
<p>This PyPy release supports:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32/64 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</p></li>
<li><p>big- and little-endian variants of <strong>PPC64</strong> running Linux,</p></li>
<li><p><strong>s390x</strong> running Linux</p></li>
<li><p>64-bit <strong>ARM</strong> machines running Linux.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>PyPy does support ARM 32 bit processors, but does not release binaries.</p>

<p>Somebody wrote this super cool thread on Twitter about using <a class="reference external" href="https://graphviz.org">Graphviz</a> to make
software visualize its internal state:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">🧵 Make yours and everybody else's lives slightly less terrible by having all your programs print out their internal stuff as pictures; ✨ a thread ✨ <a href="https://t.co/NjQ42bXN2E">pic.twitter.com/NjQ42bXN2E</a></p>— Kate (@thingskatedid) <a href="https://twitter.com/thingskatedid/status/1386077306381242371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2021</a>
</blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>PyPy is using this approach a lot too and I collected a few screenshots of that
technique <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/cfbolz/status/1386315196982079491">on Twitter</a> and I thought it would make a nice blog post too!</p>
<p>The most important view early in the project, and the way that our Graphviz
visualizations got started was that we implemented a way to look at the control
flow graphs of our RPython functions after type inference. They are in static
single information form (<a class="reference external" href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.9976">SSI</a>), a variant of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">SSA</a> form. Hovering over the
variables shows the inferred types in the footer:</p>
<img alt="/images/2021-graphviz-02-cfg-types.png" src="../images/2021-graphviz-02-cfg-types.png"><p>There's another view that shows the inferred call graph of the program:</p>
<img alt="/images/2021-graphviz-05-call-graph.png" src="../images/2021-graphviz-05-call-graph.png"><p>A related viewer shows the inferred class hierarchy (in this case the exception
hierarchy) and you can focus on a single class, which will show you its base
classes and all the methods and instance attributes that were found:</p>
<img alt="/images/2021-graphviz-03-classhier.png" src="../images/2021-graphviz-03-classhier.png"><img alt="/images/2021-graphviz-04-classhier-detailed.png" src="../images/2021-graphviz-04-classhier-detailed.png"><p>We also have a view to show us the traces that are produced by the tracing JIT
tests. this viewer doesn't really scale to the big traces that the full Python
interpreter produces, but it's really useful during testing:</p>
<img alt="/images/2021-graphviz-06-trace.png" src="../images/2021-graphviz-06-trace.png"><p>Then there are more traditional tree views, eg here is a parse tree for a small
piece of Python source code:</p>
<img alt="/images/2021-graphviz-07-parse-tree.png" src="../images/2021-graphviz-07-parse-tree.png"><p>Parsing-related we have visualized the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2008/01/visualizing-python-tokenizer-5020282079473796926.html">DFAs of the parser</a> in the past,
though the code is unfortunately lost.</p>
<p>All these visualizations are made by walking the relevant data structures and
producing a Graphviz input file using a bit of string manipulation, which is
quite easy to do. Knowing a bit of Graphviz is a really useful skill, it's
super easy to make throwaway visualizations.</p>
<p>For example here is a one-off thing I did when debugging our <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2019/10/pypys-new-json-parser-492911724084305501.html">JSON parser</a> to
show the properties of the objects used in a huge example json file:</p>
<img alt="/images/2021-graphviz-08-json-parser.png" src="../images/2021-graphviz-08-json-parser.png"><p>On top of graphviz, we have a custom tool called the <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/default/dotviewer">dotviewer</a>, which is
written in Python and uses <a class="reference external" href="https://pygame.org">Pygame</a> to give you a zoomable, pannable, searchable
way to look at huge Graphviz graphs. All the images in this post are
screenshots of that tool. In its simplest form it takes any .dot files as
input.</p>
<p>Here's a small video dotviewer, moving around and searching in the json graph.
By writing a bit of extra Python code the dotviewer can also be extended to add
hyperlinks in the graphs to navigate to different views (for example, we did
that for the callgraphs above).</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SsTmJ5_Yzh8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>All in all this is a really powerful approach to understand the behaviour of
some of code, or when debugging complicated problems and we have gotten a
huge amount of mileage out of this over the years. It can be seen as an instance
of <a class="reference external" href="https://moldabledevelopment.com/">moldable development</a> ("a way of programming through which you construct
custom tools for each problem"). And it's really easy to get into! The Graphviz
language is quite a simple text-based language that can be applied to a huge
amount of different visualization situations.</p>

<p>We are no longer releasing a Python3.6 version, as we focus on updating to
Python 3.8. We have begun streaming the advances towards this goal on Saturday
evenings European time on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.twitch.tv/pypyproject">https://www.twitch.tv/pypyproject</a>. If Python3.6 is
important to you, please reach out as we could offer sponsored longer term
support.</p>
<p>The two interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. Highlights of the release include binary <strong>Windows 64</strong> support,
faster numerical instance fields, and a preliminary HPy backend.</p>
<p>A new contributor (Ondrej Baranovič - thanks!) took us up on the challenge to get
<a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/2073#note_141389">windows 64-bit</a> support.  The work has been merged and for the first time we
are releasing a 64-bit Windows binary package.</p>
<p>The release contains the biggest change to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2010/11/efficiently-implementing-python-objects-3838329944323946932.html">PyPy's implementation of the
instances of user-defined classes</a> in many years. The optimization was
motivated by the report of performance problems running a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/paugier/nbabel">numerical particle
emulation</a>. We implemented an optimization that stores <code class="docutils literal">int</code> and <code class="docutils literal">float</code>
instance fields in an unboxed way, as long as these fields are type-stable
(meaning that the same field always stores the same type, using the principle
of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~cbatten/pdfs/cheng-type-freezing-cgo2020.pdf">type freezing</a>). This gives significant performance improvements on
numerical pure-Python code, and other code where instances store many integers
or floating point numbers.</p>
<p>There were also a number of optimizations for methods around strings and bytes,
following user reported performance problems. If you are unhappy with PyPy's
performance on some code of yours, please report <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/">an issue</a>!</p>
<p>A major new feature is prelminary support for the Universal mode of HPy: a
new way of writing c-extension modules to totally encapsulate <code class="docutils literal">PyObject*</code>.
The goal, as laid out in the <a class="reference external" href="https://hpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">HPy documentation</a> and recent <a class="reference external" href="https://hpyproject.org/blog/posts/2021/03/hello-hpy/">HPy blog post</a>,
is to enable a migration path
for c-extension authors who wish their code to be performant on alternative
interpreters like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/graalvm/graalpython">GraalPython</a> (written on top of the Java virtual machine),
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython">RustPython</a>, and PyPy. Thanks to Oracle and IBM for sponsoring work on HPy.</p>
<p>Support for the <a class="reference external" href="https://vmprof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">vmprof</a> statistical profiler has been extended to ARM64 via a
built-in backend.</p>
<p>Several issues exposed in the 7.3.3 release were fixed. Many of them came from the
great work ongoing to ship PyPy-compatible binary packages in <a class="reference external" href="https://conda-forge.org/blog//2020/03/10/pypy">conda-forge</a>.
A big shout out to them for taking this on.</p>
<p>Development of PyPy takes place on <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy">https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy</a>.
We have seen an increase in the number of drive-by contributors who are able to
use gitlab + mercurial to create merge requests.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io">CFFI</a> backend has been updated to version 1.14.5 and the <a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io">cppyy</a> backend
to 1.14.2. We recommend using CFFI rather than C-extensions to interact with C,
and using cppyy for performant wrapping of C++ code for Python.</p>
<p>As always, we strongly recommend updating to the latest versions. Many fixes
are the direct result of end-user bug reports, so please continue reporting
issues as they crop up.</p>

<p>We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on PyPy, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython's JIT even better. Since the
previous release, we have accepted contributions from 10 new contributors,
thanks for pitching in, and welcome to the project!</p>
<p>If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a cffi / cppyy version of your library that would be performant on PyPy.
In any case both <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel">cibuildwheel</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild">multibuild system</a> support

<section id="what-is-pypy"><h3>What is PyPy?</h3>
<p>PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.7, and
soon 3.8. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">PyPy and CPython 3.7.4</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.</p>
<p>This PyPy release supports:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32/64 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</p></li>
<li><p>big- and little-endian variants of <strong>PPC64</strong> running Linux,</p></li>
<li><p><strong>s390x</strong> running Linux</p></li>
<li><p>64-bit <strong>ARM</strong> machines running Linux.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>PyPy does support ARM 32 bit processors, but does not release binaries.</p>

    <b>Looking for sponsorship</b>

<p>Apple now ships Macs which are running on an arm64 variant machine with the
latest version of MacOS, Big Sur M1.  We are getting requests for PyPy to
support this new architecture.  Here is our position on this topic (or at least
mine, Armin Rigo's), and how you can help.</p>

<p>Porting PyPy is harder than just re-running the compiler, because PyPy contains
a few big architecture-dependent "details", like the JIT compiler and the
foreign function interfaces (CFFI and ctypes).</p>

<p>Fixing the JIT compiler should not be too much work: we already support arm64,
just the Linux one.  But Apple made various details different (like the calling
conventions).  A few other parts need to be fixed too, notably CFFI and ctypes,
again because of the calling conventions.</p>

<p>Fixing that would be a reasonable amount of work.  I would do it myself for a
small amount of money.  However, the story doesn't finish here.  Obviously, the
<b>start</b> of the story would be to get ssh access to a Big Sur M1 machine.  (If at
this point you're thinking "sure, I can give you ssh access for three months",
then please read on.)  The <b>next</b> part of the story is that we need a machine
available long term.  It can be either a machine provided and maintained by a
third party, or alternatively a pot of money big enough to support the
acquision of a machine and ongoing work of one of us.</p>

<p>If we go with the provided-machine solution:  What we need isn't a lot of
resources.  Our CI requires maybe 10 GB of disk space, and a few hours of CPU
per run.  It should fit into 8 GB of RAM.  We normally do a run every night but
we can certainly lower the frequency a bit if that would help.  However, we'd
ideally like some kind of assurance that you are invested into maintaining the
machine for the next 3-5 years (I guess, see below).  We had far too many
machines that disappeared after a few months.</p>

<p>If we go with the money-supported solution: it's likely that after 3-5 years
the whole Mac base will have switched to arm64, we'll drop x86-64 support for
Mac, and we'll be back to the situation of the past where there was only one
kind of Mac machine to care about.  In the meantime, we are looking at 3-5
years of lightweight extra maintenance.  We have someone that has said he would
do it, but not for free.</p>

<p>If either of these two solutions occurs, we'll still have, I quote, "probably
some changes in distutils-type stuff to make python happy", and then some
packaging/deployment changes to support the  "universal2" architecture, i.e.
including both versions inside a single executable (which will <b>not</b> be just an
extra switch to clang, because the two versions need a different JIT backend
and so must be translated separately).</p>

<p>So, now all the factors are on the table.  We won't do the minimal "just the
JIT compiler fixes" if we don't have a plan that goes farther.  Either we get
sufficient money, and maybe support, and then we can do it quickly; or PyPy
will just remain not natively available on M1 hardware for the next 3-5 years.
We are looking forward to supporting M1, and view resources contributed by
the community as a vote of confidence in assuring the future of PyPy on this
hardware.  Contact us: <a href="mailto:pypy-dev@python.org">pypy-dev@python.org</a>, or our private mailing
list <a href="mailto:pypy-z@python.org">pypy-z@python.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    <p> The PyPy team is proud to release the version 7.3.3 of PyPy, which includes
three different interpreters:
</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18 (updated from the
previous version)</li>
<li>PyPy3.6: which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.6, including the stdlib for CPython 3.6.12 (updated from the
previous version).</li>
<li>PyPy3.7 beta: which is our second release of an interpreter supporting the
syntax and the features of Python 3.7, including the stdlib for CPython
3.7.9. We call this beta quality software, there may be issues about
compatibility with new and changed features in CPython 3.7.
Please let us know what is broken or missing. We have not implemented the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#re">documented changes</a> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">re</span></code> module, and a few other pieces are also

</ul></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the 7.3
releases, but read on to find out what is new.</p>
<p>Several issues found in the 7.3.2 release were fixed. Many of them came from the
great work by <a class="reference external" href="https://conda-forge.org/blog//2020/03/10/pypy">conda-forge</a> to ship PyPy binary packages.  A big shout out

increase in the number of drive-by contributors who are able to use gitlab +
mercurial to create merge requests.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io">CFFI</a> backend has been updated to version 1.14.3. We recommend using CFFI
rather than c-extensions to interact with C, and using <a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io">cppyy</a> for performant
wrapping of C++ code for Python.</p>
<p>A new contributor took us up on the challenge to get <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/windows.html#what-is-missing-for-a-full-64-bit-translation">windows 64-bit</a> support.
The work is proceeding on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win64</span></code> branch, more help in coding or
sponsorship is welcome. In anticipation of merging this large change, we fixed
many test failures on windows.</p>
<p>As always, this release fixed several issues and bugs.  We strongly recommend
updating. Many of the fixes are the direct result of end-user bug reports, so
please continue reporting issues as they crop up.</p>
<p>You can find links to download the v7.3.3 releases here:</p>

<p>We would like to thank our <a href="https://opencollective.com/pypy">donors</a> for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/index.html">PyPy</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on pypy, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython’s JIT even better. Since the
previous release, we have accepted contributions from 2 new contributors,
thanks for pitching in.</p>
<p>If you are a python library maintainer and use c-extensions, please consider
making a cffi / cppyy version of your library that would be performant on PyPy.
In any case both <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel">cibuildwheel</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild">multibuild system</a> support
building wheels for PyPy.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">What is PyPy?</span></h2>
<p>PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.6, and
3.7. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">PyPy and CPython 3.7.4</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.</p>
<p>This PyPy release supports:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>
<b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <b>PPC64</b> running Linux,</li>
<li>
<b>s390x</b> running Linux</li>

<p>PyPy does support ARM 32 bit processors, but does not release binaries.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.2 of PyPy, which includes
three different interpreters:
</div>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.13</li>
<li>PyPy3.6: which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.6, including the stdlib for CPython 3.6.9.</li>
<li>PyPy3.7 alpha: which is our first release of an interpreter supporting the
syntax and the features of Python 3.7, including the stdlib for CPython
3.7.9. We call this an alpha release since it is our first. It is based off PyPy 3.6 so
issues should be around compatibility and not stability. Please try it out
and let us know what is broken or missing. We have not implemented some of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#re">documented changes</a> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">re</span></code> module, and other pieces are also
missing. For more information, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/wikis/py3.7%20status">PyPy 3.7 wiki</a> page</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the 7.3.0 (Dec
2019) and 7.3.1 (April 2020) releases, but read on to find out what is new.</p>
<p>Conda Forge now <a class="reference external" href="https://conda-forge.org/blog//2020/03/10/pypy">supports PyPy</a> as a python interpreter. The support is quite
complete for linux and macOS. This is the result of a lot of
hard work and good will on the part of the Conda Forge team.  A big shout out
to them for taking this on.</p>
<p>Development of PyPy has transitioning to <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy">https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy</a>.

<p>NumPy has begun shipping wheels on PyPI for PyPy, currently for linux 64-bit
only.  Wheels for PyPy windows will be available from the next NumPy release. Thanks to NumPy for their support.<br></p>
<p>A new contributor took us up on the challenge to get windows 64-bit support.

    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>PyPy is now a <a href="https://opencollective.com/pypy">member of Open Collective</a>, a fiscal host.  We have been thinking about switching to this organization for a couple of years; we like it for various reasons, like the budget transparency and the lightweight touch.  We can now officially announce our membership!</p>

<p>With this, we are now again free to use PyPy for all financial issues, like receiving funds professionally, paying parts of sprint budgets as we like, and so on.  We will shortly be reintroducing buttons that link to Open Collective from the PyPy web site.</p>

<p>Although the old donation buttons were removed last year, we believe that there are still a few people that send regularly money to the SFC, the not-for-profit charity we were affiliated with.  If you do, please stop doing it now (and, if you like to do so, please set up an equivalent donation to <a href="https://opencollective.com/pypy">PyPy on Open Collective</a>).</p>

<p>And by the way, sorry for all of you who were getting mixed feelings from the previous blog post (co-written with the SFC).  <b>PyPy is committed to continue being Open Source just like before.</b>  This was never in question.  What these two blog posts mean is only that we switched to a different organization for our internal finances.</p>

<p>We're looking forward to how this new relationship will go!</p>

<p>Armin Rigo, for the PyPy team</p>
