    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Some news from the JIT front.  Progress on the JIT has been low-profile
in the past few months.  No big results to announce yet, but we have
played with some new ideas, and they are now documented as a draft
research paper: <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/user/cfbolz/jitpl/paper/prologjit1.pdf">Towards Just-In-Time Compilation and Specialisation of Prolog.</a></p>

<p>Prolog?  Yes.  To understand this slightly unusual choice of programming
language, here is first some background about our JIT.</p>

<p>PyPy contains not a JIT but a <i>JIT generator,</i> which means that we
only write an interpreter for a language (say, the complete Python
language), and we get a JIT "for free".  More precisely, it's not for
free: we had to write the JIT generator, of course, as well as some
amount of subtle generic support code.  The JIT generator preprocesses
the (complete Python) interpreter that we wrote and links the result
with the generic support code; the result is a (complete Python) JIT.</p>

<p>The way that this works so far gives us a generated JIT that is very
similar to <a href="https://psyco.sourceforge.net">Psyco</a> in the way
it works.
But Psyco has issues (and so the current PyPy JITs have the same issues):
it can sometimes produce too much machine code,
e.g. by failing to notice that two versions of the machine code are
close enough that they should really be one; and it can also sometimes
fail in the opposite way, by making a single sub-efficient version of
the machine code instead of several efficient specialized versions.</p>

<p>A few months ago we have chosen to experiment with improving this
instead of finishing and polishing what we had so far.  The choice was
mostly because we were (and still are) busy finishing and polishing
everything else in PyPy, so it was more fun to keep at least the JIT on
the experimental side.  Besides, PyPy is now getting to a rather good
and complete state, and it is quite usable without the JIT already.</p>

<p>Anyway, enough excuses.  Why is this about Prolog?</p>

<p>In PyPy, both the (complete Python) interpreter and the JIT support code
are in RPython.  Now RPython is not
an extremely complicated language, but still, it is far from the top on a
minimalism scale.  In general, this is a good in practice (or at least I
think so): it gives
a reasonable balance because it is convenient to write interpreters
in RPython, while not being so bloated that it makes our translation
toolchain horribly complicated (e.g. writing garbage collectors for
RPython - or even JIT generators - is reasonable).  Still, it is not the
best choice for early research-level experimentation.</p>

<p>So what we did instead recently is hand-write, in Prolog, a JIT that
looks similar to what we would like to achieve for RPython with our JIT
generator.  This gave much quicker turnaround times than we were used to
when we played around directly with RPython.  We wrote tiny example
interpreters in Prolog (of course not a complete Python interpreter).
Self-inspection is trivial in Prolog, and generating Prolog code at
runtime is very easy too.  Moreover, many other issues are also easier
in Prolog: for example, all data structures are immutable "terms".
Other languages than Prolog would have worked, too, but it happens to be
one that we (Carl Friderich, Michael Leuschel and myself) are familiar
with -- not to mention that it's basically a nice small dynamic
language.</p>

<p>Of course, all this is closely related to what we want to do in PyPy.
The fundamental issues are the same.  Indeed, in PyPy, the major goals
of the JIT are to remove, first, the overhead of allocating objects all
the time (e.g. integers), and second, the overhead of dynamic dispatch
(e.g. finding out that it's integers we are adding).  The equivalent
goals in Prolog are, first, to avoid creating short-lived terms, and
second, to remove the overhead of dispatch (typically, the dispatching
to multiple clauses).  If you are familiar with Prolog you can find more
details about this <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/user/cfbolz/jitpl/paper/prologjit1.pdf">in the paper.</a> So far we already played with many possible solutions
in the Prolog JIT, and the paper describes the most mature one; we have
more experimentation in mind.  The main point here is that these are
mostly language-independent techniques (anything that works both in
Prolog and in RPython has to be language-independent, right? :-)</p>

<p>In summary, besides the nice goal of speeding up Prolog, we are trying
to focus our Prolog JIT on the issues and goals that have equivalents in
the PyPy JIT generator.  So in the end we are pretty convinced that it
will give us something that we can backport to PyPy -- good ideas about
what works and what doesn't, as well as some concrete algorithms.</p>

          <p>One thing I've never quite understood: how will the JIT-generation transform interact with more traditional optimization schemes?<br><br>Concrete example: say in a function I want to perform some algebraic reductions of math operations which will change a lot of the instructions.  Since the JIT generation turns the interpreter into a JIT, presumably I have to write the optimization at the interpreter level.  <br><br>I can see how that could work for the simplest kind of optimizations (special cases should be specialized at runtime after they go green, if I understand the rainbow colour scheme.)<br><br>I don't see yet how the more complex optimizations I'd write on static, fixed-type code will look in this context.  IIUC at interpreter level I can only access the JIT's observations via tests like "if type(a) == FloatType" which should be filled after they're known-- but that's inside the function itself, and I don't see how to access that information from anything outside.</p>

          <p>dsm: This is a two-level approach, corresponding to two levels of optimisations that are useful for dynamic languages like Python: the "high level" is the unboxing and dispatching removing that I describe in the post (which by itself can give something like a factor 50-100 speed-up in the best cases).  Traditional "low level" optimisations can be performed on top of that, by optimising the generated code that comes out of the "high level" (and this could give another 2-4x speed-up, i.e. the same difference as between "gcc" and "gcc -O3").<br><br>In this Prolog experiment we are only focusing on how to get the high level optimisations.</p>

          <p>Shalabh: It's also important to note 3 big benefits of implementing a language in the language itself, or a subset thereof ("turtles all the way down").<br><br>(1) Debugging and testing tools for programs written in the language then (hopefully) also work for debugging and testing the language implementation with minimal (or no) modification.  This also HUGELY lowers the bar for ordinary users of the language to find and fix implementation bugs.  This isn't a fault of Prolog, but 99.99% of Python users won't touch a Prolog debugger with a 10-foot pole.<br><br>(2) The largest pool of people most interested in improving the language is presumably the expert heavy users of the language.  Forcing them to learn a new language and/or implement the language in a language outside their expertise is a large disadvatage.<br><br>(3) The difference between language builtins and user code is reduced.  Also, it forces certain powerful constructs to (at times) be exposed in the language when they might otherwise only be exposed in the implementation language.  Also, with "turtles all the way down", performance improvements in the language itself also often apply to the language builtins, which increases the benefit of improvements, which is important in the cost/benefit analysis for undertaking the performance improvements in the first place.  Having "turtles all the way down" make some optimizations worthwhile that otherwise would be too much trouble to implement.</p>

approach</a>: the video starts in February 2003, when the first PyPy
sprint took place in Hildesheim: after a lot of initial activity, few
commits happened in the next two months, until the second PyPy sprint,
which took place in Gothenburg in late May 2003; around the minute
0:15, you can see the high commit rate due to the sprint.</p>
<p>The next two years follow more or less the same pattern: very high
activity during sprints, followed by long pauses between them; the
most interesting breaking point is located around the minute 01:55;
it's January 2005, and when the EU project starts, the number of
commits just explodes, as well as the number of people involved.</p>
<p>I also particularly appreciated minute 03:08 aka March 22, 2006: it's
the date of my first commit to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dist/</span></tt>, and my nickname magically
appears; but of course I'm biased :-).</p>

    <p>As readers of this blog already know, <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/home.html">PyPy</a> development has
recently focused on getting the code base to a more usable state. One
of the most important parts of this work was creating an
implementation of the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/lib/module-ctypes.html">ctypes module</a> for PyPy, which
provides a realistic way to interface with external libraries. The
module is now fairly complete (if somewhat slow), and has generated a
great deal of community interest.  One of the main reasons this work
progressed so well was that we received funding from <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/opensource/">Google's Open
Source Programs Office</a>.  This is
really fantastic for us, and we cannot thank Google and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/%7Eguido/">Guido</a> enough for helping PyPy progress
more rapidly than we could have with volunteer-only time!</p>
<p>This funding opportunity arose from the <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2007/11/pypy-road-show.html">PyPy US road trip</a> at the end
of last year, which included a <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2007/11/pypy-google-tech-talk-9082134238390123890.html">visit to Google</a>. You
can check out <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnPmErtqPXk">the video</a>
of the talk we gave during our visit.  We wrapped up our day with
discussions about the possibility of Google funding some PyPy work and
soon after a we were at work on the proposal for improvements we'd
submitted.</p>
<p>One nice side-effect of the funding is indeed that we can use some of
the money for funding travels of contributors to our sprint meetings.
The next scheduled Google funding proposal also aims at making our
Python interpreter more usable and compliant with <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/CPython">CPython</a>. This will be done by trying to
fully run <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.org/">Django</a> on top of PyPy.  With
more efforts like this one we're hoping that PyPy can start to be used
as a CPython replacement before the end of 2008.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the teams at <a class="reference external" href="https://merlinux.de/">merlinux</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.openend.se/">Open End</a> for making this development possible, including
Carl Friedrich Bolz, Antonio Cuni, Holger Krekel, Maciek Fijalkowski
at merlinux, Samuele Pedroni and yours truly at Open End.</p>
<p>We always love to hear feedback from the community, and you can get
the latest word on our development and let us know your thoughts <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/">here in the comments</a>.</p>

    <p>When hacking on PyPy, I spend a lot of time inside pdb; thus, I tried
to create a more comfortable environment where I can pass my nights
:-).</p>
<p>As a result, I wrote two modules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/svn/user/antocuni/hack/pdb.py">pdb.py</a>, which extends the default behaviour of pdb, by adding
some commands and some fancy features such as syntax highlight and
powerful tab completion; pdb.py is meant to be placed somewhere in
your PYTHONPATH, in order to override the default version of pdb.py
shipped with the stdlib;</li>
<li>
<a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/svn/user/antocuni/hack/rlcompleter_ng.py">rlcompleter_ng.py</a>, whose most important feature is the ability
to show coloured completions depending on the type of the objects.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To find more informations about those modules and how to install them,
have a look at their docstrings.</p>
<p>It's important to underline that these modules are not PyPy specific,
and they work perfectly also on top of CPython.</p>

          <p>That's pretty impressive, but I think having to modify readline itself in order to do this is a little excessive. readline's completion capabilities are pretty limited. I wonder if there are any better alternatives that could be used with Python.<br><br>I have something similar set up for my Python prompt: https://bitheap.org/hg/dotfiles/file/tip/.pythonrc.py -- it allows completion and indentation, it persists command history with readline, and it prints documentation if you try to evaluate certain objects like functions, classes, and methods. It also pretty-prints output, but I'm still trying to tweak it so it's aware of the terminal width.</p>

    <p>Another episode of the "Running Real Application of top of PyPy" series:
<br><br>
Today's topic: <a href="https://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow">Divmod's Nevow</a>. Nevow (pronounced as the French "nouveau", or "noo-voh") is a web application construction kit written in Python.  Which means it's just another web framework, but this time built on top of Twisted.
While, due to some small problems we're not yet able to pass full Twisted test suite on top of pypy-c, Nevow seems to be simple enough to work perfectly (959 out of 960 unit tests passing, with the last one recognized as pointless and about to be deleted).  Also, thanks to
<a href="https://jcalderone.livejournal.com/">exarkun</a>, Nevow now no longer relies on ugly details like refcounting.
<br><br>
As usual, translate pypy using:
</p>
<div><code>
translate.py --gc=hybrid --thread targetpypystandalone --faassen --allworkingmodules --oldstyle
</code></div>
<br>
Of course, obligatory to the series, screenshot:<br><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5R1EBmwBBTs/SFrvyFF9keI/AAAAAAAAAA0/c7SbGfUVOuw/s1600-h/nevow.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213743162274451938" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5R1EBmwBBTs/SFrvyFF9keI/AAAAAAAAAA0/c7SbGfUVOuw/s400/nevow.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand;"></a>
This is Nevow's own test suite.

    <p>As happened in the last years, there will be a PyPy sprint just after
<a class="reference" href="https://www.europython.org/">EuroPython</a>.  The sprint will take place in the same hotel as the
conference, from 10th to 12th of July.</p>
<p>This is a fully public sprint: newcomers are welcome, and on the first
day we will have a tutorial session for those new to PyPy development.</p>
<p>Some of the topics we would like to work on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>try out Python programs and fix them or fix PyPy or fix performance bottlenecks</li>
<li>some JIT improvement work</li>
<li>port the stackless transform to ootypesystem</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, other topics are also welcome.</p>

about what Python is and why it is interesting and then moving to explaining and

          <p>Thanks CF for linking - i found it actually a fun interview although i was  caught a bit in surprise that it focused first a lot on Python-the-language and i didn't feel in evangelising mode.<br><br>And what i again realized is that PyPy is not too well known or understood outside the Python world.

    <p>The next episode of the "Running Real Applications on Top of PyPy" series: <br><br>
Yesterday, we spend some time with <a href="https://dunderboss.blogspot.com/">Philip Jenvey</a> on tweaking Pylons and PyPy to cooperate with each other. While doing this we found some pretty <a href="../posts/2008/06/list-comprehension-implementation-5289956690288817225.html">obscure details</a>, but in general things went well.
<br><br>
After resolving some issues, we can now run all (72) Pylons tests on
top of pypy-c compiled with the following command:
<br><br></p>
<div><code>
translate.py --gc=hybrid --thread targetpypystandalone --faassen --allworkingmodules --oldstyle
</code></div>
<br>
and run some example application. Here is the obligatory screenshot (of course
it might be fake, as usual with screenshots). Note: I broke application <b>on purpose</b> to showcase cool debugger, default screen is just boring:<br><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5R1EBmwBBTs/SE7eAboWYkI/AAAAAAAAAAs/MsTwAcGUxx0/s1600-h/pylons-screenshot.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210345917912605250" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5R1EBmwBBTs/SE7eAboWYkI/AAAAAAAAAAs/MsTwAcGUxx0/s400/pylons-screenshot.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand;"></a>
Please note that we run example application without DB access, since
we need some more work to get <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> run on top of pypy-c together with
pysqlite-ctypes. Just one example of an obscure details that sqlalchemy is
relying on in the test suite:
<br><br><code>
  class A(object):<br>
    locals()[42] = 98
</code>
<br><br><b>Update:</b>This is only about new-style classes.
<br><br>
This works on CPython and doesn't on PyPy.<br><br>
Cheers,<br>

          <p>Very good to see this work! This is a a good thing to be trying and hearing it makes me happy.<br><br>We're busy working on making Zope 3 run on Jython, which should get make some of our C level dependencies optional. These make a port to PyPy harder as well. Zope 3 libraries have umpteen thousands of tests that can be run, so that should give one some coverage. The libraries come packaged separately too. <br><br>The trickiest part would be those bits that depend on the ZODB. Porting the ZODB to PyPy should allow new possibilities, but it'll be hard too, I imagine.</p>

          <p>Hi Martijn, <br><br>in fact having zope3 work with pypy would be very nice.  i discussed a bit with Phillip and he suggested to first get zope.interface and zope.component to work, then zope.proxy/zope.security.  IIRC my first try with zope.interface yielded 3 failures out of 231 tests.  I had to hack the test runner a bit to not rely on GC details - i guess that your work for Jython might imply that as well.  What is the best way to follow your Jython work, btw?<br><br>best &amp; cheers, <br>holger</p>

          <p>PJE: What you say is mostly beside the point. PyPy has no problem at all with non-string keys in (old-style) class dicts. The point is more that locals() cannot be used to assign things to this dictionary, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>:<br><br>"<b>locals()</b><br>    Update and return a dictionary representing the current local symbol table.

          <p>Well, if you plan on supporting, say, Zope or Twisted, you'll need to support modifying class-body frame locals.<br><br>There really isn't any point to optimizing them, not only due to PEP 3115, but also due to pre-3115 metaclasses.

    <p>List comprehensions are a nice feature in Python. They are, however, just
syntactic sugar for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loops. E.g. the following list comprehension:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f(l):
    return [i ** 2 for i in l if i % 3 == 0]
</pre>
<p>is sugar for the following <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loop:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f(l):
    result = []
    for i in l:
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(i ** 2)
    return result
</pre>
<p>The interesting bit about this is that list comprehensions are actually
implemented in almost exactly this way. If one disassembles the two functions
above one gets sort of similar bytecode for both (apart from some details, like
the fact that the append in the list comprehension is done with a special
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LIST_APPEND</span></tt> bytecode).</p>
<p>Now, when doing this sort of expansion there are some classical problems: what
name should the intermediate list get that is being built? (I said classical
because this is indeed one of the problems of many macro systems). What CPython
does is give the list the name <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_[1]</span></tt> (and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_[2]</span></tt>... with nested list
comprehensions). You can observe this behaviour with the following code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ python
Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Apr 21 2008, 11:12:42)
[GCC 4.2.3 (Ubuntu 4.2.3-2ubuntu7)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; [dir() for i in [0]][0]
['_[1]', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'i']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [[dir() for i in [0]][0] for j in [0]][0]
['_[1]', '_[2]', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'i', 'j']
</pre>
<p>That is a sort of nice decision, since you can not reach that name by any
"normal" means. Of course you can confuse yourself in funny ways if you want:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; [locals()['_[1]'].extend([i, i + 1]) for i in range(10)]
[0, 1, None, 1, 2, None, 2, 3, None, 3, 4, None, 4, 5, None, 5, 6, None, 6, 7, None, 7, 8, None, 8, 9, None, 9, 10, None]
</pre>
<p>Now to the real reason why I am writing this blog post. PyPy's Python
interpreter implements list comprehensions in more or less exactly the same way,
with on tiny difference: the name of the variable:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ pypy-c-53594-generation-allworking
Python 2.4.1 (pypy 1.0.0 build 53594) on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
``the globe is our pony, the cosmos our real horse''
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [dir() for i in [0]][0]
['$list0', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'i']
</pre>
<!-- ::
][)())`` hack -->
<p>Now, that shouldn't really matter for anybody, should it? Turns out it does. The
following way too clever code is <a class="reference" href="https://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=__name%5C+for%5C+__name%5C+in%5C+locals&amp;sbtn=Search">apparently used a lot</a>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
__all__ = [__name for __name in locals().keys() if not __name.startswith('_') '
               or __name == '_']
</pre>
<p>In PyPy this will give you a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"$list0"</span></tt> in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt>, which will prevent the
import of that module :-(. I guess I need to change the name to match CPython's.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: no detail is obscure enough to not have some code depending
on it. Mostly problems on this level of obscurity are the things we are fixing
in PyPy at the moment.</p>

          <p>In fairness, the clever code does not depend on the name looking as it actually does in CPython; the clever code merely expects that variables auto-created by Python internals will begin with an underscore.

          <p>turingtest: I agree that that would be preferable, but it's sort of hard with the current interpreter design. Also, it's a pragmatic implementation in that the interpreter didn't have to change at all to add the list comps.</p>

          <p>The code's not overly clever, it's ridiculous, because it exactly duplicates the effects of not having __all__ at all.

    <p>As PyPy is getting more and more usable, we need better tools to use to work on certain applications running on top of PyPy. Out of this interest, I spent some time implementing the <b>_lsprof</b> module, which is a part of the standard library since Python2.5. It is necessary for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/lib/module-profile.html">cProfile</a> module, which can profile Python programs with high accuracy and a lot less overhead than the older, pure-python <b>profile</b> module. Together with the excellent
<a href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/tool/lsprofcalltree.py">lsprofcalltree</a> script, you can display this data using <a href="https://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi">kcachegrind</a>, which gives you great visualization possibilities for your profile data.
