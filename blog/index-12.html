    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>In the past few months, we made tremendous <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2009/11/some-benchmarking-9211261260383281459.html">progress</a> on the JIT front.
To monitor the progress daily, we introduced recently some <a class="reference external" href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/plotsummary.html">cool graphs</a>
that plot revision vs performance. They are based on <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/">unladen swallow</a>
benchmark runner and they're written entirely in JavaScript, using canvas
via the <a class="reference external" href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/flot/">Flot</a> libraries.
It's amazing what you can do in JavaScript these days... They are also
tested via the very good <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oejskit">oejskit</a> plugin, that integrates <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/">py.test</a>
with JavaScript testing, driven by the command line.</p>
<p>As you can probably see, we're very good on some benchmarks and not that
great on others. Some of the bad results come from the fact that while we
did a lot of JIT-related work, other PyPy parts did not see that much
love. Some of our algorithms on the builtin data types are inferior to those
of CPython. This is going to be an ongoing focus for a while.</p>
<p>We want to first improve on the benchmarks for a couple
of weeks before doing a release to gather further feedback.</p>
<p>Cheers,
fijal</p>

          <p>Hey.<br><br>Regarding revisions - by default it points to the first one we have graphs from, so you can just slice :) Also, yeah, revision numbers and dates should show up, will fix that.

    <p>PyPy has recently made some great <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2009/11/some-benchmarking-9211261260383281459.html">speed</a> and <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2009/10/gc-improvements-6174120095428192954.html">memory</a> progress towards providing the most efficient Python interpreter out there.  We also just announced
<a class="reference external" href="../posts/2009/12/planning-next-release-of-pypy-4193252449406707091.html">our plans for the pypy-1.2 release</a>.  Much of this is driven by personal
commitment, by individuals and companies investing time and money.
Now we'd appreciate some feedback and help regarding getting money
into the PyPy project to help its core members (between
5 and 15 people depending how you count) to sustain themselves.  We see
several options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>use a foundation structure and ask for tax-exempt donations to the
project, its developers and infrastructure.  We just got
a letter from the <a class="reference external" href="https://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> that they view
our application favourably so this option becomes practical hopefully
soon.</li>
<li>offer to implement certain features like a 64bit JIT-backend,
Numpy for PyPy or a streamlined installation in exchange for money,
contributed in small portions/donations.  Do you imagine you or your
company would sponsor PyPy on a small scale for efforts like this?
Any other bits you'd like to see?</li>
<li>offer to implement larger scale tasks by contracting PyPy related companies,
namely <a class="reference external" href="https://www.openend.se">Open End</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://merlinux.eu">merlinux</a> who have successfully done such
contracts in the past.  Please don't hesitate to contact
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:holger@merlinux.eu">holger@merlinux.eu</a> and <a class="reference external" href="mailto:bea@openend.se">bea@openend.se</a> if you want to start a
conversation on this.</li>
<li>apply for public/state funding - in fact we are likely to get some
funding through <a class="reference external" href="https://www.eureka.dlr.de/de/194.php">Eurostars</a>, more on that separately.  Such funding
is usually only a 50-60% percentage of actual employment and
project costs, and is tied to research questions rather than
to make PyPy a production-useable interpreter, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else we should look out for?</p>
<p>cheers &amp; thanks for any feedback,
Maciej and Holger</p>

          <p>What about activating the Python Users Groups around the world? I think the case has to be made for PyPy still to the regular folk, if you will. So - what if you conducted a video showing off it's potential, or maybe a series of videos, much like the "Summer of NHibernate" series. All the while, on the same site as the videos, you have a "tips" jar for donations. The videos would serve as great marketing campaign and would invite the development community into the fold, earning the buy-in you seek. This kind of attention in the community would only serve the project well when attracting the larger fish to the pond.<br><br>Just my thoughts. :)</p>

          <p>@kitblake good point.  The main blocker for making PyPy useful on mobile phones is support for GUI apps.  Alexander's recent <a href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2009/11/using-cpython-extension-modules-with.html" rel="nofollow">PyPy QT experiments</a> are teasing in this direction. To fully exploit PyPy's super-efficient memory usage we probably  need to provide native bindings. That and maybe a GIL-less interpreter would make PyPy a superior choice for mobile devices.  <br><br>However, GUI-bindings/free threading are orthogonal to the ongoing JIT-efforts. Somehow PyPy suffers a bit from its big potential (there also is stackless and sandboxing etc.). Question is: (How) can we make donation/other funding guide PyPy developments and at the same time support dedicated developers?</p>

          <p>Niki, generally thats a viable approach. Pyside is moving to shiboken, a new framework for generating bindings. Somebody would have to check how large the effort is to port it to RPython. <br>Currently, Pyside is using Boost::Python AFAIK.</p>

    <p>The PyPy core team is planning to make a new release before the next Pycon US.</p>
<p>The main target of the 1.2 release is packaging the good results
we have achieved applying our current JIT compiler generator to our
Python interpreter. Some of that progress <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2009/10/gc-improvements-6174120095428192954.html">has been</a> <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2009/11/dusseldorf-sprint-report-2505348213879053352.html">chronicled in</a>
<a class="reference external" href="../posts/2009/11/some-benchmarking-9211261260383281459.html">recent posts</a> on the status blog. By releasing them in a
relatively stable prototype we want to encourage people to try them with their
own code and to gather feedback in this way. By construction the JIT compiler
should support all Python features, what may vary are the speedups
achieved (in some cases the JIT may produce worse results than the PyPy
interpreter which we would like to know) and the extra memory required
by it.</p>
<p>For the 1.2 release we will focus on the JIT stability first, less on
improving non-strictly JIT areas. The JIT should be good at many things
as shown by previous blog postings. We want the JIT compiler in the
release to work well on <strong>Intel 32 bits</strong> on Linux, with Mac OS X and
Windows being secondary targets.  Which compilation targets work will
depend a bit on contributions.</p>
<p>In order to finalize the release we intend to have a concentrated
effort ("virtual sprint") from the 22nd to the 29th of
January. Coordination will happen as usual through the #pypy irc
channel on freenode. Samuele Pedroni will take the role of release
manager as he already did in the past.</p>

    <div class="document" id="using-cpython-extension-modules-with-pypy-or-pyqt-on-pypy">

<p>If you have ever wanted to use CPython extension modules on PyPy,
we want to announce that there is a solution that should be compatible
to quite a bit of the available modules. It is neither new nor written
by us, but works nevertheless great with PyPy.</p>
<p>The trick is to use RPyC, a transparent, symmetric remote procedure
call library written in Python. The idea is to start a
CPython process that hosts the PyQt libraries
and connect to it via TCP to send RPC commands to it.</p>
<p>I tried to run PyQt applications
using it on PyPy and could get quite a bit of the functionality of these
working. Remaining problems include regular segfaults of CPython
because of PyQt-induced memory corruption and bugs because classes
like StandardButtons behave incorrectly when it comes to arithmetical operations.</p>
<p>Changes to RPyC needed to be done to support remote unbound <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></tt> methods,
shallow call by value for list and dict types (PyQt4 methods want real lists and dicts
as parameters), and callbacks to methods (all remote method objects are wrapped into
small lambda functions to ease the call for PyQt4).</p>
<p>If you want to try RPyC to run the PyQt application of your choice, you just
need to follow these steps. Please report your experience here in the blog
comments or on our <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">mailing list</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Download RPyC from the <a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/rpyc/files/">RPyC download page</a>.</li>
<li>Download this <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/svn/user/xoraxax/rpyc-3.0.7-pyqt4-compat.patch">patch</a> and apply it to RPyC by running
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">patch</span> <span class="pre">-p1</span> <span class="pre">&lt;</span> <span class="pre">rpyc-3.0.7-pyqt4-compat.patch</span></tt> in the RPyC directory.</li>
<li>Install RPyc by running <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">install</span></tt> as root.</li>
<li>Run the file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rpyc/servers/classic_server.py</span></tt> using CPython.</li>
<li>Execute your PyQt application on PyPy.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>PyPy will automatically connect to CPython and use its PyQt libraries.</p>
<p>Note that this scheme works with nearly every extension library. Look
at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy/lib/sip.py</span></tt> on how to add new libraries (you need to create
such a file for every proxied extension module).</p>
<p>Have fun with PyQt</p>

    <p>Hello.
</p>
<p>
Recently, thanks to the surprisingly helpful Unhelpful, also known as Andrew Mahone,
we have a decent, if slightly arbitrary, set of performances graphs.
It contains a couple of benchmarks already
seen on this blog as well as some taken from <a href="https://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">The Great Computer
Language Benchmarks Game</a>. These benchmarks don't even try to represent "real applications"
as they're mostly small algorithmic benchmarks. Interpreters used:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
PyPy trunk, revision 69331 with --translation-backendopt-storesink, which is
now on by default
</li>
<li>
Unladen swallow trunk, r900
</li>
<li>CPython 2.6.2 release</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here are the graphs; the benchmarks and the runner script are <a href="https://www.looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/python-benchmarks/">available</a>
</p>

<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5R1EBmwBBTs/SwRteBYi01I/AAAAAAAAAOU/BU3h_VUfmH0/s1600/result.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5405565815286322002" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5R1EBmwBBTs/SwRteBYi01I/AAAAAAAAAOU/BU3h_VUfmH0/s400/result.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 400px; height: 300px;"></a>

And zoomed in for all benchmarks except binary-trees and fannkuch.
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5R1EBmwBBTs/SwRtnxYPJII/AAAAAAAAAOc/JAvE6pYaEjI/s1600/result2.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5405565982788756610" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5R1EBmwBBTs/SwRtnxYPJII/AAAAAAAAAOc/JAvE6pYaEjI/s400/result2.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 400px; height: 300px;"></a>

<p>
As we can see, PyPy is generally somewhere between the same speed
as CPython to 50x faster (f1int). The places where we're the same
speed as CPython are places where we know we have problems - for example generators are
not sped up by the JIT and they require some work (although not as much by far
as generators &amp; Psyco :-). The glaring inefficiency is in the regex-dna benchmark.
This one clearly demonstrates that our regular expression engine is really,
really, bad and urgently requires attention.
</p>
<p>
The cool thing here is, that although these benchmarks might not represent
typical python applications, they're not uninteresting. They show
that algorithmic code does not need to be far slower in Python than in C,
so using PyPy one need not worry about algorithmic code being dramatically
slow. As many readers would agree, that kills yet another usage of C in our
lives :-)
</p>

          <p>ASFAIU it's not PyPy's regex engine being "bad" but rather the fact that the JIT generator cannot consider and optimize the loop in the regex engine, as it is a nested loop (the outer one being the bytecode interpretation one).</p>

          <p>@holger: yes, that explains why regexps are not faster in PyPy, but not why they are 5x or 10x slower.  Of course our regexp engine is terribly bad.  We should have at least a performance similar to CPython.</p>

    <p>While the Düsseldorf is dwindling off, we put our minds to the task of retelling
our accomplishments. The sprint was mostly about improving the JIT and we         
managed to stick to that task (as much as we managed to stick to anything). The   
sprint was mostly filled with doing many small things.</p>                        
<div class="section" id="inlining">                                               
<h2>Inlining</h2>                                                                 
<p>Carl Friedrich and Samuele started the sprint trying to tame the JIT's inlining.
Until now, the JIT would try to inline everything in a loop (except other loops)  
which is what most tracing JITs actually do. This works great if the resulting    
trace is of reasonable length, but if not it would result in excessive memory     
consumption and code cache problems in the CPU. So far we just had a limit on     
the trace size, and we would abort tracing when the limit was reached. This       
would happen again and again for the same loop, which is not useful at all. The   
new approach introduced is to be more clever when tracing is aborted by marking   
the function with the largest contribution to the trace size as non-inlinable. The
next time this loop is traced, it usually then gives a reasonably sized trace.</p>
<p>This gives a problem because now some functions that don't contain loops are not
inlined, which means they never get assembler code for them generated. To remedy  
this problem we also make it possible to trace functions from their start (as     
opposed to just tracing loops). We do that only for functions that can not be     
inlinined (either because they contain loops or they were marked as               
non-inlinable as described above).</p>                                            
<p>The result of this is that the <a class="reference external" href="https://svn.python.org/view/sandbox/trunk/decimal/telco/">Python version</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://speleotrove.com/decimal/telco.html">telco decimal benchmark</a> runs                                 
to completion without having to arbitrarily increase the trace length limit.                    
It's also about 40% faster than running it on CPython. This is one of the first                 
non-tiny programs that we speed up.</p>                                                         
</div>                                                                                          
<div class="section" id="reducing-gc-pressure">                                                 
<h2>Reducing GC Pressure</h2>                                                                   
<p>Armin and Anto used some GC instrumentation to find places in pypy-c-jit                     
that allocate a lot of memory. This is an endlessly surprising exercise, as                     
usually we don't care too much about allocations of short-lived objects when                    
writing RPython, as our GCs usually deal well with those. They found a few                      
places where they could remove allocations, most importantly by making one of                   
the classes that make up traces smaller.</p>

<h2>Optimizing Chains of Guards</h2>                                                            
<p>Carl Friedrich and Samuele started a simple optimization on the trace level that             
removes superfluous guards. A common pattern in a trace is to have stronger                     
and stronger guards about the same object. As an example, often there is first a                
guard that an object is not None, later followed by a guard that it is exactly                  
of a given class and then even later that it is a precise instance of that                      
class. This is inefficient, as we can just check the most precise thing in the                  
place of the first guard, saving us guards (which take memory, as they need resume data).       
Maciek, Armin and Anto later improved on that by introducing a new guard that                   
checks for non-nullity and a specific class in one guard, which allows us to                    
collapse more chains.</p>                                                                       
</div>

<h2>Improving JIT and Exceptions</h2>                                                           
<p>Armin and Maciek went on a multi-day quest to make the JIT and Python-level                  
exceptions like each other more. So far, raising and catching exceptions would                  
make the JIT generate code that has a certain amusement value, but is not really                
fast in any way. To improve the situation, they had to dig into the exception                   
support in the Python interpreter, where they found various inefficiencies. They                
also had to rewrite the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">exceptions</span></tt> module to be in RPython (as opposed to                                                             
just pure Python + an old hack). Another problems is that tracebacks give you                   
access to interpreter frames. This forces the JIT to deoptimize things, as                      
the JIT keeps some of the frame's content in CPU registers or on the CPU stack,                 
which reflective access to frames prevents.                                                     
Currently we try to improve the simple cases where the traceback is never                       
actually accessed. This work is not completely finished, but some cases are                     
already significantly faster.</p>

<p>Holger worked on porting PyPy to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/py/dist/announce/release-1.1.0.html">newly released</a> py.test 1.1. PyPy                   
still uses some very old support code in its testing infrastructure, which makes                
this task a bit annoying. He also gave the other PyPy developers a demo of some                 
of the newer py.test features and we discussed which of them we want to start                   
using to improve our tests to make them shorter and clearer. One of the things                  
we want to do eventually is to have less skipped tests than now.</p>

<h2>Using a Simple Effect Analysis for the JIT</h2>                                             
<p>One of the optimization the JIT does is caching fields that are read out of                  
structures on the heap. This cache needs to be invalidated at some points, for
example when such a field is written to (as we don't track aliasing much).
Another case is a call in the assembler, as the target function could
arbitrarily change the heap. This of course is imprecise, since most functions
don't actually change the whole heap, and we have an analysis that finds out
which sorts of types of structs and arrays a function can mutate. During the
sprint Carl Friedrich and Samuele integrated this analysis with the JIT, to help
it invalidate caches less aggressively. Later Anto and Carl Friedrich also
ported this support to the CLI version of the JIT.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="miscellaneous">
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Samuele (with some assistance of Carl Friedrich) set up a buildbot slave on a
Mac Mini at the University. This should let us stabilize on the Max OS X. So far
we still have a number of <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net:8099/summary?category=mac">failing tests</a>, but now we are in a situation to
sanely approach fixing them.</p>
<p>Anto improved the CLI backend to support the infrastructure for producing the

    <p>The Düsseldorf sprint starts today. Only Samuele and me are there so far, but that should change over the course of the day. We will mostly work on the JIT during this sprint, trying to make it a lot more practical. For that we need to decrease its memory requirements some more and to make it use less aggressive inlining. We will post more as the sprint progresses.</p>

    <p>Hello.
</p>
<p>
It's maybe a bit late to announce, but there will be PyPy talk
at <a href="https://rupy.eu">Rupy</a> conference this weekend in
Poznan. Precisely, I'll be talking mostly about PyPy's JIT and
how to use it. Unfortunately the talk is on Saturday, at 8:30 in the morning.
</p>
<p>
<b>EDIT:</b> Talk is <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/rupy2009">online</a>, together with examples
</p>
Cheers,<br>

    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>This week I worked on improving the system we use for logging.  Well, it was not really a "system" but rather a pile of hacks to measure in custom ways timings and counts and display them.  So now, we have a system :-)</p>

<p>The system in question was integrated in the code for the GC and the JIT, which are two independent components as far as the source is concerned.  However, we can now display a unified view.  Here is for example pypy-c-jit running pystone for (only) 5000 iterations:</p>

<a href="https://codespeak.net/~arigo/raw/pystone.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5399212353093417154" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Sg3NUJ-JhgU/Su3bB2UIuMI/AAAAAAAAAAM/2-Vf5zry_4Q/s320/pystone.png" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 320px; height: 51px;"></a>

<p>The top long bar represents time.  The bottom shows two summaries of the total time taken by the various components, and also plays the role of a legend to understand the colors at the top.  Shades of red are the GC, shades of green are the JIT.</p>

<p>Here is another picture, this time on pypy-c-jit running 10 iterations of richards:</p>

<a href="https://codespeak.net/~arigo/raw/richards.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5399212511216555922" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Sg3NUJ-JhgU/Su3bLDXoV5I/AAAAAAAAAAU/VPxEP_hqrFk/s320/richards.png" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 320px; height: 19px;"></a>

<p>We have to look more closely at various examples, but a few things immediately show up.  One thing is that the GC is put under large pressure by the jit-tracing, jit-optimize and (to a lesser extent) the jit-backend components.  So large in fact that the GC takes at least 60-70% of the time there.  We will have to do something about it at some point.  The other thing is that on richards (and it's likely generally the case), the jit-blackhole component takes a lot of time.  "Blackholing" is the operation of recovering from a guard failure in the generated assembler, and falling back to the interpreter.  So this is also something we will need to improve.</p>

<p>That's it!  The images were generated with the following commands:</p>

<pre>PYPYLOG=/tmp/log pypy-c-jit richards.py
python pypy/tool/logparser.py draw-time /tmp/log --mainwidth=8000 --output=filename.png</pre>

<i><b>EDIT:</b> nowadays the command-line has changed to:</i><pre>python rpython/tool/logparser.py draw-time /tmp/log --mainwidth=8000 filename.png</pre>
