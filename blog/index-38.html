<tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> is PyPy's subsystem which provides a compatibility
layer to compile and run CPython C extensions inside PyPy.  Often people ask
why a particular C extension doesn't work or is very slow on PyPy.
Usually it is hard to answer without going into technical details. The goal of
this blog post is to explain some of these technical details, so that we can
simply link here instead of explaining again and again :).<br>
From a 10.000 foot view, <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> is PyPy's version of <tt class="docutils literal">"Python.h"</tt>. Every time
you compile an extension which uses that header file, you are using <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>.
This includes extension explicitly written in C (such as <tt class="docutils literal">numpy</tt>) and
extensions which are generated from other compilers/preprocessors
(e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">Cython</tt>).<br>
At the time of writing, the current status is that most C extensions "just
work". Generally speaking, you can simply <tt class="docutils literal">pip install</tt> them,
provided they use the public, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/index.html">official C API</a> instead of poking at private
implementation details.  However, the performance of cpyext is generally
poor. A Python program which makes heavy use of <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> extensions
is likely to be slower on PyPy than on CPython.<br>
Note: in this blog post we are talking about Python 2.7 because it is still
the default version of PyPy: however most of the implementation of <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> is
shared with PyPy3, so everything applies to that as well.<br><div class="section" id="c-api-overview">
<h1>
C API Overview</h1>
In CPython, which is written in C, Python objects are represented as <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>,
i.e. (mostly) opaque pointers to some common "base struct".<br>
CPython uses a very simple memory management scheme: when you create an
object, you allocate a block of memory of the appropriate size on the heap.
Depending on the details, you might end up calling different allocators, but
for the sake of simplicity, you can think that this ends up being a call to
<tt class="docutils literal">malloc()</tt>. The resulting block of memory is initialized and casted to to
<tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>: this address never changes during the object lifetime, and the
C code can freely pass it around, store it inside containers, retrieve it
later, etc.<br>
Memory is managed using reference counting. When you create a new reference to
an object, or you discard a reference you own, you have to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_INCREF">increment</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_DECREF">decrement</a> the reference counter accordingly. When the reference counter goes to
0, it means that the object is no longer used and can safely be
destroyed. Again, we can simplify and say that this results in a call to
<tt class="docutils literal">free()</tt>, which finally releases the memory which was allocated by <tt class="docutils literal">malloc()</tt>.<br>
Generally speaking, the only way to operate on a <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> is to call the
appropriate API functions. For example, to convert a given <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> to a C
integer, you can use <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/int.html#c.PyInt_AsLong">PyInt_AsLong()</a>; to add two objects together, you can
call <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Add">PyNumber_Add()</a>.<br>
Internally, PyPy uses a similar approach. All Python objects are subclasses of
the RPython <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> class, and they are operated by calling methods on the
<tt class="docutils literal">space</tt> singleton, which represents the interpreter.<br>
At first, it looks very easy to write a compatibility layer: just make
<tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> an alias for <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt>, and write simple RPython functions
(which will be translated to C by the RPython compiler) which call the
<tt class="docutils literal">space</tt> accordingly:<br><pre class="code python literal-block"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">PyInt_AsLong</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">space</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> <span class="name">o</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="name">space</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">int_w</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">o</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>

<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">PyNumber_Add</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">space</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> <span class="name">o1</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> <span class="name">o2</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="name">space</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">add</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">o1</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> <span class="name">o2</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
</pre>
Actually, the code above is not too far from the real
implementation. However, there are tons of gory details which make it much
harder than it looks, and much slower unless you pay a lot of attention
to performance.</div>
<div class="section" id="the-pypy-gc">
<h1>
The PyPy GC</h1>
To understand some of <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> challenges, you need to have at least a rough
idea of how the PyPy GC works.<br>
Contrarily to the popular belief, the "Garbage Collector" is not only about
collecting garbage: instead, it is generally responsible for all memory
management, including allocation and deallocation.<br>
Whereas CPython uses a combination of malloc/free/refcounting to manage
memory, the PyPy GC uses a completely different approach. It is designed
assuming that a dynamic language like Python behaves the following way:<br><blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You create, either directly or indirectly, lots of objects.</li>
<li>Most of these objects are temporary and very short-lived. Think e.g. of
doing <tt class="docutils literal">a + b + c</tt>: you need to allocate an object to hold the temporary
result of <tt class="docutils literal">a + b</tt>, then it dies very quickly because you no longer need it
when you do the final <tt class="docutils literal">+ c</tt> part.</li>
<li>Only small fraction of the objects survive and stay around for a while.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
So, the strategy is: make allocation as fast as possible; make deallocation of
short-lived objects as fast as possible; find a way to handle the remaining
small set of objects which actually survive long enough to be important.<br>
This is done using a <strong>Generational GC</strong>: the basic idea is the following:<br><blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>We have a nursery, where we allocate "young objects" very quickly.</li>
<li>When the nursery is full, we start what we call a "minor collection".<ul>
<li>We do a quick scan to determine the small set of objects which survived so
far</li>
<li>We <strong>move</strong> these objects out of the nursery, and we place them in the
area of memory which contains the "old objects". Since the address of the
objects changes, we fix all the references to them accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>now the nursery contains only objects which "died young". We can
discard all of them very quickly, reset the nursery, and use the same area
of memory to allocate new objects from now.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
In practice, this scheme works very well and it is one of the reasons why PyPy
is much faster than CPython.  However, careful readers have surely noticed
that this is a problem for <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>. On one hand, we have PyPy objects which
can potentially move and change their underlying memory address; on the other
hand, we need a way to represent them as fixed-address <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> when we
pass them to C extensions.  We surely need a way to handle that.</div>
<div class="section" id="pyobject-in-pypy">
<h1>
<tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> in PyPy</h1>
Another challenge is that sometimes, <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> structs are not completely
opaque: there are parts of the public API which expose to the user specific
fields of some concrete C struct. For example the definition of <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/typeobj.html">PyTypeObject</a>
which exposes many of the <tt class="docutils literal">tp_*</tt> slots to the user.
Since the low-level layout of PyPy <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> objects is completely different
than the one used by CPython, we cannot simply pass RPython objects to C; we
need a way to handle the difference.<br>
So, we have two issues so far: objects can move, and incompatible
low-level layouts. <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> solves both by decoupling the RPython and the C
representations. We have two "views" of the same entity, depending on whether
we are in the PyPy world (the movable <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> subclass) or in the C world
(the non-movable <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>).<br><tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> are created lazily, only when they are actually needed. The
vast majority of PyPy objects are never passed to any C extension, so we don't
pay any penalty in that case. However, the first time we pass a <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> to
C, we allocate and initialize its <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> counterpart.<br>
The same idea applies also to objects which are created in C, e.g. by calling
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/allocation.html#c.PyObject_New">PyObject_New()</a>. At first, only the <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> exists and it is
exclusively managed by reference counting. As soon as we pass it to the PyPy
world (e.g. as a return value of a function call), we create its <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt>
counterpart, which is managed by the GC as usual.<br>
Here we start to see why calling cpyext modules is more costly in PyPy than in
CPython. We need to pay some penalty for all the conversions between
<tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>.<br>
Moreover, the first time we pass a <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> to C we also need to allocate
the memory for the <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> using a slowish "CPython-style" memory
allocator. In practice, for all the objects which are passed to C we pay more
or less the same costs as CPython, thus effectively "undoing" the speedup
guaranteed by PyPy's Generational GC under normal circumstances.</div>
<div class="section" id="maintaining-the-link-between-w-root-and-pyobject">
<h1>
Maintaining the link between <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>
</h1>
We now need a way to convert between <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> and
vice-versa; also, we need to to ensure that the lifetime of the two entities
are in sync. In particular:<br><blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>as long as the <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> is kept alive by the GC, we want the
<tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> to live even if its refcount drops to 0;</li>
<li>as long as the <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> has a refcount greater than 0, we want to
make sure that the GC does not collect the <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
The <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> â‡¨ <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> link is maintained by the special field
<a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/py3.6/pypy/module/cpyext/parse/cpyext_object.h#lines-5">ob_pypy_link</a> which is added to all <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>. On a 64 bit machine this
means that all <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> have 8 bytes of overhead, but then the
conversion is very quick, just reading the field.<br>
For the other direction, we generally don't want to do the same: the
assumption is that the vast majority of <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> objects will never be
passed to C, and adding an overhead of 8 bytes to all of them is a
waste. Instead, in the general case the link is maintained by using a
dictionary, where <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> are the keys and <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> the values.<br>
However, for a <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/py3.6/pypy/module/cpyext/pyobject.py#lines-66">few selected</a> <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> subclasses we <strong>do</strong> maintain a
direct link using the special <tt class="docutils literal">_cpy_ref</tt> field to improve performance. In
particular, we use it for <tt class="docutils literal">W_TypeObject</tt> (which is big anyway, so a 8 bytes
overhead is negligible) and <tt class="docutils literal">W_NoneObject</tt>. <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> is passed around very
often, so we want to ensure that the conversion to <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> is very
fast. Moreover it's a singleton, so the 8 bytes overhead is negligible as
well.<br>
This means that in theory, passing an arbitrary Python object to C is
potentially costly, because it involves doing a dictionary lookup.  We assume
that this cost will eventually show up in the profiler: however, at the time
of writing there are other parts of <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> which are even more costly (as we
will show later), so the cost of the dict lookup is never evident in the
profiler.</div>
<div class="section" id="crossing-the-border-between-rpython-and-c">
<h1>
Crossing the border between RPython and C</h1>
There are two other things we need to care about whenever we cross the border
between RPython and C, and vice-versa: exception handling and the GIL.<br>
In the C API, exceptions are raised by calling <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/exceptions.html#c.PyErr_SetString">PyErr_SetString()</a> (or one of
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/exceptions.html#exception-handling">many other functions</a> which have a similar effect), which basically works by
creating an exception value and storing it in some global variable. The
function then signals that an exception has occurred by returning an error value,
usually <tt class="docutils literal">NULL</tt>.<br>
On the other hand, in the PyPy interpreter, exceptions are propagated by raising the
RPython-level <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/py3.6/pypy/interpreter/error.py#lines-20">OperationError</a> exception, which wraps the actual app-level
exception values. To harmonize the two worlds, whenever we return from C to
RPython, we need to check whether a C API exception was raised and if so turn it
into an <tt class="docutils literal">OperationError</tt>.<br>
We won't dig into details of <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/py3.6/pypy/module/cpyext/api.py#lines-205">how the GIL is handled in cpyext</a>.
For the purpose of this post, it is enough to know that whenever we enter
C land, we store the current thread id into a global variable which is
accessible also from C; conversely, whenever we go back from RPython to C, we
restore this value to 0.<br>
Similarly, we need to do the inverse operations whenever you need to cross the
border between C and RPython, e.g. by calling a Python callback from C code.<br>
All this complexity is automatically handled by the RPython function
<a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/py3.6/pypy/module/cpyext/api.py#lines-1757">generic_cpy_call</a>. If you look at the code you see that it takes care of 4
things:<br><blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Handling the GIL as explained above.</li>
<li>Handling exceptions, if they are raised.</li>
<li>Converting arguments from <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>.</li>
<li>Converting the return value from <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
So, we can see that calling C from RPython introduce some overhead.
Can we measure it?<br>
Assuming that the conversion between <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> has a
reasonable cost (as explained by the previous section), the overhead
introduced by a single border-cross is still acceptable, especially if the
callee is doing some non-negligible amount of work.<br>
However this is not always the case. There are basically three problems that
make (or used to make) <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> super slow:<br><blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Paying the border-crossing cost for trivial operations which are called
very often, such as <tt class="docutils literal">Py_INCREF</tt>.</li>
<li>Crossing the border back and forth many times, even if it's not strictly
needed.</li>
<li>Paying an excessive cost for argument and return value conversions.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
The next sections explain in more detail each of these problems.</div>
<div class="section" id="avoiding-unnecessary-roundtrips">
<h1>
Avoiding unnecessary roundtrips</h1>
Prior to the <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2017/10/cape-of-good-hope-for-pypy-hello-from-3656631725712879033.html">2017 Cape Town Sprint</a>, <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> was horribly slow, and we were
well aware of it: the main reason was that we never really paid too much
attention to performance. As explained in the blog post, emulating all the
CPython quirks is basically a nightmare, so better to concentrate on
correctness first.<br>
However, we didn't really know <strong>why</strong> it was so slow. We had theories and
assumptions, usually pointing at the cost of conversions between <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>, but we never actually measured it.<br>
So, we decided to write a set of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antocuni/cpyext-benchmarks">cpyext microbenchmarks</a> to measure the
performance of various operations.  The result was somewhat surprising: the
theory suggests that when you do a cpyext C call, you should pay the
border-crossing costs only once, but what the profiler told us was that we
were paying the cost of <tt class="docutils literal">generic_cpy_call</tt> several times more than what we expected.<br>
After a bit of investigation, we discovered this was ultimately caused by our
"correctness-first" approach. For simplicity of development and testing, when
we started <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> we wrote everything in RPython: thus, every single API call
made from C (like the omnipresent <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/arg.html#c.PyArg_ParseTuple">PyArg_ParseTuple()</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/int.html#c.PyInt_AsLong">PyInt_AsLong()</a>, etc.)
had to cross back the C-to-RPython border. This was especially daunting for
very simple and frequent operations like <tt class="docutils literal">Py_INCREF</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Py_DECREF</tt>,
which CPython implements as a single assembly instruction!<br>
Another source of slow down was the implementation of <tt class="docutils literal">PyTypeObject</tt> slots.
At the C level, these are function pointers which the interpreter calls to do
certain operations, e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_new">tp_new</a> to allocate a new instance of that type.<br>
As usual, we have some magic to implement slots in RPython; in particular,
<a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/py3.6/pypy/module/cpyext/api.py#lines-362">_make_wrapper</a> does the opposite of <tt class="docutils literal">generic_cpy_call</tt>: it takes a
RPython function and wraps it into a C function which can be safely called
from C, handling the GIL, exceptions and argument conversions automatically.<br>
This was very handy during the development of cpyext, but it might result in
some bad nonsense; consider what happens when you call the following C
function:<br><pre class="code C literal-block"><span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="name">PyObject</span><span class="operator">*</span> <span class="name function">foo</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">PyObject</span><span class="operator">*</span> <span class="name">self</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> <span class="name">PyObject</span><span class="operator">*</span> <span class="name">args</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
<span class="punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="name">PyObject</span><span class="operator">*</span> <span class="name">result</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="name">PyInt_FromLong</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="literal number integer">1234</span><span class="punctuation">);</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="name">result</span><span class="punctuation">;</span>
<span class="punctuation">}</span>
</pre>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>you are in RPython and do a cpyext call to <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt>: <strong>RPython-to-C</strong>;</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt> calls <tt class="docutils literal">PyInt_FromLong(1234)</tt>, which is implemented in RPython:
<strong>C-to-RPython</strong>;</li>
<li>the implementation of <tt class="docutils literal">PyInt_FromLong</tt> indirectly calls
<tt class="docutils literal">PyIntType.tp_new</tt>, which is a C function pointer: <strong>RPython-to-C</strong>;</li>
<li>however, <tt class="docutils literal">tp_new</tt> is just a wrapper around an RPython function, created
by <tt class="docutils literal">_make_wrapper</tt>: <strong>C-to-RPython</strong>;</li>
<li>finally, we create our RPython <tt class="docutils literal">W_IntObject(1234)</tt>; at some point
during the <strong>RPython-to-C</strong> crossing, its <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> equivalent is
created;</li>
<li>after many layers of wrappers, we are again in <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt>: after we do
<tt class="docutils literal">return result</tt>, during the <strong>C-to-RPython</strong> step we convert it from
<tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">W_IntObject(1234)</tt>.</li>
</ol>
Phew! After we realized this, it was not so surprising that <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> was very
slow :). And this was a simplified example, since we are not passing a
<tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> to the API call. When we do, we need to convert it back and
forth at every step.  Actually, I am not even sure that what I described was
the exact sequence of steps which used to happen, but you get the general
idea.<br>
The solution is simple: rewrite as much as we can in C instead of RPython,
to avoid unnecessary roundtrips. This was the topic of most of the Cape Town
sprint and resulted in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cpyext-avoid-roundtrip</span></tt> branch, which was
eventually <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/cpyext_avoid-roundtrip">merged</a>.<br>
Of course, it is not possible to move <strong>everything</strong> to C: there are still
operations which need to be implemented in RPython. For example, think of
<tt class="docutils literal">PyList_Append</tt>: the logic to append an item to a list is complex and
involves list strategies, so we cannot replicate it in C.  However, we
discovered that a large subset of the C API can benefit from this.<br>
Moreover, the C API is <strong>huge</strong>. While we invented this new way of writing
<tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> code, we still need to
convert many of the functions to the new paradigm.  Sometimes the rewrite is
not automatic
or straighforward. <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> is a delicate piece of software, so it happens often
that we make a mistake and end up staring at a segfault in gdb.<br>
However, the most important takeaway is that the performance improvements we got
from this optimization are impressive, as we will detail later.</div>
<div class="section" id="conversion-costs">
<h1>
Conversion costs</h1>
The other potential big source of slowdown is the conversion of arguments
between <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>.<br>
As explained earlier, the first time you pass a <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> to C, you need to
allocate its <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> counterpart. Suppose you have a <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt> function
defined in C, which takes a single int argument:<br><pre class="code python literal-block"><span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="name">i</span> <span class="operator word">in</span> <span class="name builtin">range</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">N</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
    <span class="name">foo</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">i</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
</pre>
To run this code, you need to create a different <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> for each value
of <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>: if implemented naively, it means calling <tt class="docutils literal">N</tt> times <tt class="docutils literal">malloc()</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">free()</tt>, which kills performance.<br>
CPython has the very same problem, which is solved by using a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_list">free list</a> to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Objects/intobject.c#L16">allocate ints</a>. So, what we did was to simply <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/d8754ab9ba6371c83eaeb80cdf8cc13a37ee0c89">steal the code</a> from CPython
and do the exact same thing. This was also done in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cpyext-avoid-roundtrip</span></tt> branch, and the benchmarks show that it worked
perfectly.<br>
Every type which is converted often to <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> must have a very fast
allocator. At the moment of writing, PyPy uses free lists only for ints and
<a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/35e2fb9903f2483940d7970bd83ce8c65aa1c1a3">tuples</a>: one of the next steps on our TODO list is certainly to use this
technique with more types, like <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt>.<br>
Conversely, we also need to optimize the conversion from <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> to
<tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt>: this happens when an object is originally allocated in C and
returned to Python. Consider for example the following code:<br><pre class="code python literal-block"><span class="keyword namespace">import</span> <span class="name namespace">numpy</span> <span class="keyword namespace">as</span> <span class="name namespace">np</span>
<span class="name">myarray</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="name">np</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">random</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">random</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">N</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="name">i</span> <span class="operator word">in</span> <span class="name builtin">range</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name builtin">len</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">arr</span><span class="punctuation">)):</span>
    <span class="name">myarray</span><span class="punctuation">[</span><span class="name">i</span><span class="punctuation">]</span>
</pre>
At every iteration, we get an item out of the array: the return type is a an
instance of <tt class="docutils literal">numpy.float64</tt> (a numpy scalar), i.e. a <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject'*</tt>: this is
something which is implemented by numpy entirely in C, so completely
opaque to <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>. We don't have any control on how it is allocated,
managed, etc., and we can assume that allocation costs are the same as on
CPython.<br>
As soon as we return these <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> to Python, we need to allocate
their <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> equivalent. If you do it in a small loop like in the example
above, you end up allocating all these <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> inside the nursery, which is
a good thing since allocation is super fast (see the section above about the
PyPy GC).<br>
However, we also need to keep track of the <tt class="docutils literal">W_Root</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> link.
Currently, we do this by putting all of them in a dictionary, but it is very
inefficient, especially because most of these objects die young and thus it
is wasted work to do that for them.  Currently, this is one of the biggest
unresolved problem in <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>, and it is what causes the two microbenchmarks
<tt class="docutils literal">allocate_int</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">allocate_tuple</tt> to be very slow.<br>
We are well aware of the problem, and we have a plan for how to fix it. The
explanation is too technical for the scope of this blog post as it requires a
deep knowledge of the GC internals to be understood, but the details are
<a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/extradoc/-/blob/branch/extradoc/planning/cpyext.txt#L27">here</a>.</div>
<div class="section" id="c-api-quirks">
<h1>
C API quirks</h1>
Finally, there is another source of slowdown which is beyond our control. Some
parts of the CPython C API are badly designed and expose some of the
implementation details of CPython.<br>
The major example is reference counting. The <tt class="docutils literal">Py_INCREF</tt> / <tt class="docutils literal">Py_DECREF</tt> API
is designed in such a way which forces other implementation to emulate
refcounting even in presence of other GC management schemes, as explained
above.<br>
Another example is borrowed references. There are API functions which <strong>do
not</strong> incref an object before returning it, e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/list.html#c.PyList_GetItem">PyList_GetItem()</a>.  This is
done for performance reasons because we can avoid a whole incref/decref pair,
if the caller needs to handle the returned item only temporarily: the item is
kept alive because it is in the list anyway.<br>
For PyPy, this is a challenge: thanks to <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2011/10/more-compact-lists-with-list-strategies-8229304944653956829.html">list strategies</a>, lists are often
represented in a compact way. For example, a list containing only integers is
stored as a C array of <tt class="docutils literal">long</tt>.  How to implement <tt class="docutils literal">PyList_GetItem</tt>? We
cannot simply create a <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt> on the fly, because the caller will never
decref it and it will result in a memory leak.<br>
The current solution is very inefficient. The first time we do a
<tt class="docutils literal">PyList_GetItem</tt>, we <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/py3.6/pypy/module/cpyext/listobject.py#lines-28">convert</a> the <strong>whole</strong> list to a list of
<tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>. This is bad in two ways: the first is that we potentially pay a
lot of unneeded conversion cost in case we will never access the other items
of the list. The second is that by doing that we lose all the performance
benefit granted by the original list strategy, making it slower for the
rest of the pure-python code which will manipulate the list later.<br><tt class="docutils literal">PyList_GetItem</tt> is an example of a bad API because it assumes that the list
is implemented as an array of <tt class="docutils literal">PyObject*</tt>: after all, in order to return a
borrowed reference, we need a reference to borrow, don't we?<br>
Fortunately, (some) CPython developers are aware of these problems, and there
is an ongoing project to <a class="reference external" href="https://pythoncapi.readthedocs.io/">design a better C API</a> which aims to fix exactly
this kind of problem.<br>
Nonetheless, in the meantime we still need to implement the current
half-broken APIs. There is no easy solution for that, and it is likely that
we will always need to pay some performance penalty in order to implement them
correctly.<br>
However, what we could potentially do is to provide alternative functions
which do the same job but are more PyPy friendly: for example, we could think
of implementing <tt class="docutils literal">PyList_GetItemNonBorrowed</tt> or something like that: then, C
extensions could choose to use it (possibly hidden inside some macro and
<tt class="docutils literal">#ifdef</tt>) if they want to be fast on PyPy.</div>
<div class="section" id="current-performance">
<h1>
Current performance</h1>
During the whole blog post we claimed <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> is slow. How
slow it is, exactly?<br>
We decided to concentrate on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antocuni/cpyext-benchmarks">microbenchmarks</a> for now. It should be evident
by now there are simply too many issues which can slow down a <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>
program, and microbenchmarks help us to concentrate on one (or few) at a
time.<br>
The microbenchmarks measure very simple things, like calling functions and
methods with the various calling conventions (no arguments, one arguments,
multiple arguments); passing various types as arguments (to measure conversion
costs); allocating objects from C, and so on.<br>
Here are the results from the old PyPy 5.8 relative and normalized to CPython
2.7, the lower the better:<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

PyPy was horribly slow everywhere, ranging from 2.5x to 10x slower. It is
particularly interesting to compare <tt class="docutils literal">simple.noargs</tt>, which measures the cost
of calling an empty function with no arguments, and <tt class="docutils literal">simple.onearg(i)</tt>,
which measures the cost calling an empty function passing an integer argument:
the latter is ~2x slower than the former, indicating that the conversion cost
of integers is huge.<br>
PyPy 5.8 was the last release before the famous Cape Town sprint, when we
started to look at cpyext performance seriously. Here are the performance data for
PyPy 6.0, the latest release at the time of writing:<br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MRkRoxtCeOE/W6UOL5txl1I/AAAAAAAABX8/i0ZiOyS2MOgiSyxFAyMOkKcB6xqjSihBACLcBGAs/s1600/pypy60.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MRkRoxtCeOE/W6UOL5txl1I/AAAAAAAABX8/i0ZiOyS2MOgiSyxFAyMOkKcB6xqjSihBACLcBGAs/s640/pypy60.png" width="640"></a>

<br><br>
The results are amazing! PyPy is now massively faster than before, and for
most benchmarks it is even faster than CPython: yes, you read it correctly:
PyPy is faster than CPython at doing CPython's job, even considering all the
extra work it has to do to emulate the C API.  This happens thanks to the JIT,
which produces speedups high enough to counterbalance the slowdown caused by
cpyext.<br>
There are two microbenchmarks which are still slower though: <tt class="docutils literal">allocate_int</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">allocate_tuple</tt>, for the reasons explained in the section about
<a class="reference internal" href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3971202189709462152#conversion-costs">Conversion costs</a>.</div>
<div class="section" id="next-steps">
<h1>
Next steps</h1>
Despite the spectacular results we got so far, <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> is still slow enough to
kill performance in most real-world code which uses C extensions extensively
(e.g., the omnipresent numpy).<br>
Our current approach is something along these lines:<br><blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>run a real-world small benchmark which exercises cpyext</li>
<li>measure and find the major bottleneck</li>
<li>write a corresponding microbenchmark</li>
<li>optimize it</li>
<li>repeat</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
On one hand, this is a daunting task because the C API is huge and we need to
tackle functions one by one.  On the other hand, not all the functions are
equally important, and is is enough to optimize a relatively small subset to
improve many different use cases.<br>
Where a year ago we announced we have a working answer to run c-extension in
PyPy, we now have a clear picture of what are the performance bottlenecks, and
we have developed some technical solutions to fix them. It is "only" a matter
of tackling them, one by one.  It is worth noting that most of the work was
done during two sprints, for a total 2-3 person-months of work.<br>
We think this work is important for the Python ecosystem. PyPy has established
a baseline for performance in pure python code, providing an answer for the
"Python is slow" detractors. The techniques used to make <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> performant
will let PyPy become an alternative for people who mix C extensions with
Python, which, it turns out, is just about everyone, in particular those using
the various scientific libraries. Today, many developers are forced to seek
performance by converting code from Python to a lower language. We feel there
is no reason to do this, but in order to prove it we must be able to run both
their python and their C extensions performantly, then we can begin to educate
them how to write JIT-friendly code in the first place.<br>
We envision a future in which you can run arbitrary Python programs on PyPy,
with the JIT speeding up the pure Python parts and the C parts running as fast
as today: the best of both worlds!</div>

    <p>A few weeks ago I (=Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick) gave a <a class="reference external" href="https://conf.researchr.org/event/ecoop-issta-2018/icooolps-2018-papers-tbd-15-years-of-pypy-a-retrospective">keynote</a> at ICOOOLPS in
Amsterdam with the above title. I was very happy to have been given that
opportunity, since a number of our papers have been published at ICOOOLPS,
including the very first one I published when I'd just started my PhD. I decided
to turn the talk manuscript into a (longish) blog post, to make it available to a wider audience.
Note that this blog post describes my personal recollections and research, it is
thus necessarily incomplete and coloured by my own experiences.</p>
<p>PyPy has turned 15 years old this year, so I decided that that's a good reason
to dig into and talk about the history of the project so far. I'm going to do
that using the lens of how performance developed over time, which is from
something like 2000x slower than CPython, to roughly 7x faster. In this post
I am going to present the history of the project, and also talk about some
lessons that we learned.</p>
<p>The post does not make too many assumptions about any prior knowledge of what
PyPy is, so if this is your first interaction with it, welcome! I have tried to
sprinkle links to earlier blog posts and papers into the writing, in case you
want to dive deeper into some of the topics.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, in this post I am going to mostly focus on ideas, and not
explain who had or implemented them. A huge amount of people contributed to the
design, the implementation, the funding and the organization of PyPy over the
years, and it would be impossible to do them all justice.</p>

<p>On the technical level PyPy is a Python interpreter written in Python, which is
where the name comes from. It also has an automatically generated JIT compiler,
but I'm going to introduce that gradually over the rest of the blog post, so
let's not worry about it too much yet. On the social level PyPy is an
interesting mixture of a open source project, that sometimes had research done
in it.</p>
<p>The project got started in late 2002 and early 2003. To set the stage, at that
point Python was a significantly less popular language than it is today. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2/">Python
2.2</a> was the version at the time, Python didn't even have a <span class="docutils literal">bool</span> type yet.</p>
<p>In fall 2002 the PyPy project was started by a number of Python programmers on a
mailing list who said
something like (I am exaggerating somewhat) "Python is the greatest most
wonderful most perfect language ever, we should use it for absolutely
everything. Well, what aren't we using it for? The Python virtual machine itself
is written in C, that's bad. Let's start a project to fix that."</p>
<p>Originally that project was called "minimal python", or "ptn", later gradually
renamed to PyPy. Here's the <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2003-January/235289.html">mailing list post</a> to announce the project more
formally:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">Minimal Python Discussion, Coding and Sprint
--------------------------------------------

We announce a mailinglist dedicated to developing
a "Minimal Python" version.  Minimal means that
we want to have a very small C-core and as much
as possible (re)implemented in python itself.  This
includes (parts of) the VM-Code.</pre>
<p>Why would that kind of project be useful? Originally it wasn't necessarily meant
to be useful as a real implementation at all, it was more meant as a kind of
executable explanation of how Python works, free of the low level details of
CPython. But pretty soon there were then also plans for how the virtual machine
(VM) could be bootstrapped to be runnable without an existing Python
implementation, but I'll get to that further down.</p>

<p>In early 2003 a group of Python people met in Hildesheim (Germany) for the first
of many week long development sprints, organized by Holger Krekel. During that
week a group of people showed up and started working on the core interpreter.
In May 2003 a second sprint was organized by Laura Creighton and Jacob HalÃ©n in
Gothenburg (Sweden). And already at that sprint enough of the Python bytecodes
and data structures were implemented to make it possible to run a program that
computed how much money everybody had to pay for the food bills of the week. And
everybody who's tried that for a large group of people knows that thatâ€™s an
amazingly complex mathematical problem.</p>
<p>In the next two years, the project continued as a open source project with
various contributors working on it in their free time, and meeting for the
occasional sprint. In that time, the rest of the core interpreter and the core
data types were implemented.</p>
<p>There's not going to be any other code in this post, but to give a bit of a
flavor of what the Python interpreter at that time looked like, here's the
implementation of the <span class="docutils literal">DUP_TOP</span> bytecode after these first sprints. As you can
see, it's in Python, obviously, and it has high level constructs such as method
calls to do the stack manipulations:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><code><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">DUP_TOP</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">f</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="../posts/2018/09/the-first-15-years-of-pypy-3412615975376972020.html#id19">Early organizational ideas</a></h1>
<p>Some of the early organizational ideas of the project were as follows. Since the
project was started on a sprint and people really liked that style of working
PyPy continued to be developed on various subsequent <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed-zAxZtGlY">sprints</a>.</p>
<p>From early on there was a very heavy emphasis on testing. All the parts of the
interpreter that were implemented had a very careful set of unit tests to make
sure that they worked correctly. From early on, there was a continuous
integration infrastructure, which grew over time (nowadays it is very natural
for people to have automated tests, and the concept of green/red builds: but
embracing this workflow in the early 2000s was not really mainstream yet, and
it is probably one of the reasons behind PyPy's success).</p>
<p>At the sprints there was also an emphasis on doing pair programming to make
sure that everybody understood the codebase
equally. There was also a heavy emphasis on writing good code and on regularly
doing refactorings to make sure that the codebase remained nice, clean and
understandable. Those ideas followed from the early thoughts that PyPy would be
a sort of readable explanation of the language.</p>
<p>There was also a pretty fundamental design decision made at the time. That was
that the project should stay out of language design completely. Instead it would
follow CPython's lead and behave exactly like that implementation in all cases.
The project therefore committed to being almost quirk-to-quirk compatible and to
implement even the more obscure (and partially unnecessary) corner cases of
CPython.</p>
<p>All of these principles continue pretty much still today (There are a few places
where we had to deviate from being completely compatible, they are documented
<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cpython_differences.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>While all this coding was going on it became clear pretty soon that the goals
that various participants had for the project would be very hard to achieve with
just open source volunteers working on the project in their spare time.
Particularly also the sprints became expensive given that those were just
volunteers doing this as a kind of weird hobby. Therefore a couple of people of
the project got together to apply for an EU grant in the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_Programmes_for_Research_and_Technological_Development#FP6_and_FP7">framework programme 6</a>
to solve these money problems. In mid-2004 that application proved to be
successful.Â And so the project got a grant of a 1.3 million Euro for
two years to be able to employ some of the core developers and to make it
possible for them work on the project full time. The EU grant went to seven
small-to-medium companies and <a class="reference external" href="https://hhu.de">Uni DÃ¼sseldorf</a>. The budget also contained money to
fund sprints, both for the employed core devs as well as other open source
contributors.</p>

<p>The EU project started in December 2004 and that was a fairly heavy change in
pace for the project. Suddenly a lot of people were working full time on it, and
the pace and the pressure picked up quite a lot. Originally it had been a
leisurely project people worked on for fun. But afterwards people discovered
that doing this kind of work full time becomes slightly less fun, particularly
also if you have to fulfill the ambitious technical goals that the EU proposal
contained. And the proposal indeed contained a bit everything to increase its
chance of acceptance, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">aspect oriented programming</a>, semantic web, logic
programming, constraint programming, and so on. Unfortunately it
turned out that those things then have to be implemented, which can be called
the first thing we learned: if you promise something to the EU, you'll have to
actually go do it (After the funding ended, a lot of these features were
actually removed from the project again, at a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2007/11/sprint-pictures.html">cleanup sprint</a>).</p>

<p>So what were the actually useful things done as part of the EU project?</p>
<p>One of the most important goals that the EU project was meant to solve was the
question of how to turn PyPy into an actually useful VM for Python. The
bootstrapping plans were taken quite directly from <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.squeak.org/squeak">Squeak</a>, which is a Smalltalk
VM written in a subset of Smalltalk called Slang, which can then be bootstrapped
to C code. The plan for PyPy was to do something similar, to define a restricted
subset of Python called RPython, restricted in such a way that it should be
possible to statically compile RPython programs to C code. Then the Python
interpreter should only use that subset, of course.</p>
<p>The main difference from the Squeak approach is that Slang, the subset of Squeak
used there, is actually quite a low level language. In a way, you could almost
describe it as C with Smalltalk syntax. RPython was really meant to be a
much higher level language, much closer to Python, with full support for single
inheritance classes, and most of Python's built-in data structures.</p>

<p>(BTW, you donâ€™t have to understand any of the illustrations in this blog post,
they are taken from talks and project reports we did over the years so they are
of archaeological interest only and I donâ€™t understand most of them myself.)</p>
<p>From 2005 on, work on the RPython type inference engine and C backend started in
earnest, which was sort of co-developed with the RPython language definition and
the PyPy Python interpreter. This is also roughly the time that I joined the
project as a volunteer.</p>
<p>And at the second sprint I went to, in July 2005, two and a half years after the
project got started, we managed to <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pypy-dev/2005-July/002239.html">bootstrap</a> the PyPy interpreter to C for the
first time. When we ran the compiled program, it of course immediately
segfaulted. The reason for that was that the C backend had turned characters
into signed chars in C, while the rest of the infrastructure assumed that they
were unsigned chars. After we fixed that, the second attempt worked and we
managed to run an incredibly complex program, something like <span class="docutils literal">6 * 7</span>. That
first bootstrapped version was really really slow, a couple of hundred times
slower than CPython.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w3Rzz7ngdz0/W5UX_THbfYI/AAAAAAAAlFA/kK33VIR3G-AlNq9CRuOdXNWbjTII6vGKwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/champagne.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w3Rzz7ngdz0/W5UX_THbfYI/AAAAAAAAlFA/kK33VIR3G-AlNq9CRuOdXNWbjTII6vGKwCPcBGAYYCw/s400/champagne.png" width="400"></a></div>
<p>The bootstrapping process of RPython has a number of nice benefits, a big one
being that a number of the properties of the generated virtual machine don't
have to expressed in the interpreter. The biggest example of this is garbage
collection. RPython is a garbage collected language, and the interpreter does
not have to care much about GC in most cases. When the C source code is
generated, a GC is automatically inserted. This is a source of great
flexibility. Over time we experimented with a number of different GC
approaches, from reference counting to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hboehm.info/gc/">Boehm</a> to our current incremental
generational collector. As an aside, for a long time we were also working on
other backends to the RPython language and hoped to be able to target Java and
.NET as well. Eventually we abandoned this strand of work, however.</p>

<div class="section" id="rpython-s-modularity-problems">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="../posts/2018/09/the-first-15-years-of-pypy-3412615975376972020.html#id22">RPython's Modularity Problems</a></h1>
<p>Now we come to the first thing I would say we learned in the project, which is
that the quality of tools we thought of as internal things still matters a lot.
One of the biggest technical mistakes we've made in the project was that we
designed RPython without any kind of story for modularity. There is no concept
of modules in the language or any other way to break up programs into smaller
components. We always thought that it would be ok for RPython to be a little bit
crappy. It was meant to be this sort of internal language with not too many
external users. And of course that turned out to be completely wrong later.</p>
<p>That lack of modularity led to various problems that persist until today. The
biggest one is that there is no separate compilation for RPython programs at
all! You always need to compile all the parts of your VM together, which leads
to infamously bad compilation times.</p>
<p>Also by not considering the modularity question we were never forced to fix
some internal structuring issues of the RPython compiler itself.
Various layers of the compiler keep very badly defined and porous interfaces between
them. This was made possible by being able to work with all the program information in one heap,
making the compiler less approachable and maintainable than it maybe could be.</p>
<p>Of course this mistake just got more and more costly to fix over time,
and so it means that so far nobody has actually done it.
Not thinking more carefully about RPython's design, particularly its
modularity story, is in my opinion the biggest technical mistake the project
made.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-meta-jit">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="../posts/2018/09/the-first-15-years-of-pypy-3412615975376972020.html#id23">2006: The Meta-JIT</a></h1>
<p>After successfully bootstrapping the VM we did some fairly straightforward
optimizations on the interpreter and the C backend and managed to reduce the
slowdown versus CPython to something like 2-5 times slower. That's great! But of
course not actually useful in practice. So where do we go from here?</p>
<p>One of the not so secret goals of Armin Rigo, one of the PyPy founders, was to
use PyPy together with some advanced <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation">partial evaluation</a> magic sauce to
somehow automatically generate a JIT compiler from the interpreter. The goal was
something like, "you write your interpreter in RPython, add a few annotations
and then we give you a JIT for free for the language that that interpreter
implements."</p>
<p>Where did the wish for that approach come from, why not just write a JIT for
Python manually in the first place? Armin had actually done just that before he
co-founded PyPy, in a project called <a class="reference external" href="https://psyco.sourceforge.net/">Psyco</a>. Psyco was an extension module for
CPython that contained a method-based JIT compiler for Python code.Â And Psyco
proved to be an amazingly frustrating compiler to write. There were two main
reasons for that. The first reason was that Python is actually quite a complex
language underneath its apparent simplicity. The second reason for the
frustration was that Python was and is very much an alive language, that gains
new features in the language core in every version. So every time a new Python
version came out, Armin had to do fundamental changes and rewrites to Psyco, and
he was getting pretty frustrated with it. So he hoped that that effort could be
diminished by not writing the JIT for PyPy by hand at all. Instead, the goal was
to generate a method-based JIT from the interpreter automatically. By taking the
interpreter, and applying a kind of advanced transformation to it, that would
turn it into a method-based JIT. And all that would still be translated into a
C-based VM, of course.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="../posts/2018/09/the-first-15-years-of-pypy-3412615975376972020.html#id24">The First JIT Generator</a></h1>
<p>From early 2006 on until the end of the EU project a lot of work went into
writing such a JIT generator. The idea was to base it on runtime partial
evaluation. Partial evaluation is an old idea in computer science. It's supposed
to be a way to automatically turn interpreters for a language into a compiler
for that same language. Since PyPy was trying to generate a JIT compiler, which
is in any case necessary to get good performance for a dynamic language like
Python, the partial evaluation was going to happen at runtime.</p>
<p>There are various ways to look at partial evaluation, but if you've never heard
of it before, a simple way to view it is that it will compile a Python function
by gluingÂ together the implementations of the bytecodes of that function and
optimizing the result.</p>
<p>The main new ideas of PyPy's partial-evaluation based JIT generator as opposed
to earlier partial-evaluation approaches are the ideas of "promote" and the idea
of "virtuals". Both of these techniques had already been present (in a slightly
less general form) in Psyco, and the goal was to keep using them in PyPy. Both
of these techniques also still remain in use today in PyPy. I'm
going on a slight technical diversion now, to give a high level explanation of
what those ideas are for.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="../posts/2018/09/the-first-15-years-of-pypy-3412615975376972020.html#id25">Promote</a></h1>
<p>One important ingredient of any JIT compiler is the ability to do runtime
feedback. Runtime feedback is most commonly used to know something about which
concrete types are used by a program in practice. Promote is basically a way to
easily introduce runtime feedback into the JIT produced by the JIT generator.
It's an <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2011/03/controlling-tracing-of-interpreter-with_15.html">annotation</a> the implementer of a language can use to express their wish
that specialization should happen at <em>this</em> point. This mechanism can be used to
express <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2011/03/controlling-tracing-of-interpreter-with_21.html">all kinds of</a> runtime feedback, moving values from the interpreter
into the compiler, whether they be types or other things.</p>
</div>


<div class="section" id="virtuals">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="../posts/2018/09/the-first-15-years-of-pypy-3412615975376972020.html#id26">Virtuals</a></h1>
<p>Virtuals are a very aggressive form of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Research/Papers/Stadler14/Stadler2014-CGO-PEA.pdf">partial escape analysis</a>. A dynamic
language often puts a lot of pressure on the garbage collector, since most
primitive types (like integers, floats and strings) are boxed in the heap, and
new boxes are allocated all the time.</p>
<p>With the help of virtuals a very significant portion of all allocations in the
generated machine code can be completely removed. Even if they can't be removed,
often the allocation can be delayed or moved into an error path, or even
into a <a class="reference external" href="https://bibliography.selflanguage.org/_static/dynamic-deoptimization.pdf">deoptimization</a> path, and thus disappear from the generated machine code
completely.</p>
<p>This optimization really is the super-power of PyPy's optimizer, since it
doesn't work only for primitive boxes but for any kind of object allocated on
the heap with a predictable lifetime.</p>
<p>As an aside, while this kind of partial escape analysis is sort of new for
object-oriented languages, it has actually existed in Prolog-based partial
evaluation systems since the 80s, because it's just extremely natural there.</p>

<p>So, back to our history. We're now in 2007, at the end of the EU project (you
can find the EU-reports we wrote during the projects <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/index-report.html">here</a>). The EU project
successfully finished, we survived the final review with the EU. So, what's the
2007 status of the JIT generator? It works kind of, it can be applied to PyPy. It
produces a VM with a JIT that will turn Python code into machine code at runtime
and run it. However, that machine code is not particularly fast. Also, it tends
to generate many megabytes of machine code even for small Python programs. While
it's always faster than PyPy without JIT, it's only sometimes faster than
CPython, and most of the time Psyco still beats it. On the one hand, this is
still an amazing achievement! It's arguably the biggest application of partial
evaluation at this point in time! On the other hand, it was still quite
disappointing in practice, particularly since some of us had believed at the
time that it should have been possible to reach and then surpass the speed of
Psyco with this approach.</p>

<p>After the EU project ended we did all kinds of things. Like sleep for a month
for example, and have the cleanup sprint that I already mentioned. We also had a
slightly unusual sprint in Bern, with members of the <a class="reference external" href="https://scg.unibe.ch/">Software Composition
Group</a> of Oscar Nierstrasz. As I wrote above, PyPy had been heavily influenced
by Squeak Smalltalk, and that group is a heavy user of Squeak, so we wanted to
see how to collaborate with them. At the beginning of the sprint, we decided
together that the goal of that week should be to try to write a Squeak virtual
machine in RPython, and at the end of the week we'd gotten surprisingly far with
that goal. Basically most of the bytecodes and the Smalltalk object system
worked, we had written an image loader and could run some benchmarks (during the
sprint we also regularly updated a <a class="reference external" href="https://pypysqueak.blogspot.com/">blog</a>, the success of which led us to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2007/10/first-post.html">start</a>
the PyPy blog).</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n0Xj6fdNu-g/W5UZE-Z0O8I/AAAAAAAAlFM/A61pBvOV-zkIrYZKDTagNbFrm6HxyFbuwCLcBGAs/s1600/bern.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n0Xj6fdNu-g/W5UZE-Z0O8I/AAAAAAAAlFM/A61pBvOV-zkIrYZKDTagNbFrm6HxyFbuwCLcBGAs/s640/bern.png" width="600"></a></div>
<p>The development of the Squeak interpreter was very interesting for the project,
because it was the first real step that moved RPython from being an
implementation detail of PyPy to be a more interesting project in its own right.
Basically a language to write interpreters in, with the eventual promise to get
a JIT for that language almost for free. That Squeak implementation is now
called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hpi-swa/RSqueak">RSqueak</a> ("Research Squeak").</p>
<p>I'll not go into more details about any of the other language implementations in
RPython in this post, but over the years we've had a large variety of language
of them done by various people and groups, most of them as research vehicles,
but also some as real language implementations. Some very cool research results
came out of these efforts, here's a slightly outdated <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">list of some of them</a>.</p>
<p>The use of RPython for other languages complicated the PyPy narrative a lot, and
in a way we never managed to recover the simplicity of the original project
description "PyPy is Python in Python". Because now it's something like "we have
this somewhat strange language, a subset of Python, that's called RPython, and
it's good to write interpreters in. And if you do that, we'll give you a JIT for
almost free. And also, we used that language to write a Python implementation,
called PyPy.". It just doesn't roll off the tongue as nicely.</p>

<p>Back to the JIT. After writing the first JIT generator as part of the EU
project, with somewhat mixed results, we actually wrote several more JIT
generator prototypes with different architectures to try to solve some of the
problems of the first approach. To give an impression of these prototypes,
hereâ€™s a list of them.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The second JIT generator we started working on in 2008 behaved exactly like
the first one, but had a meta-interpreter based architecture, to make it more
flexible and easier to experiment with. The meta-interpreter was called
the "rainbow interpreter", and in general the JIT is an area where we went
somewhat overboard with borderline silly terminology, with notable
occurrences of "timeshifter", "blackhole interpreter" etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The third JIT generator was an experiment based on the second one which
changed
compilation strategy. While the previous two had compiled many control flow
paths of the currently compiled function eagerly, that third JIT was sort of
maximally lazy and stopped compilation at every control flow split to avoid
guessing which path would actually be useful later when executing the code.
This was an attempt to reduce the problem of the first JIT generating way too
much machine code. Only later, when execution went down one of the not yet
compiled paths would it continue compiling more code. This gives an effect
similar to that of <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0352">lazy basic block versioning</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth JIT generator was a pretty strange prototype, a <a class="reference external" href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/db2d/0542c7791ee6f29a9f35e3181a186866f881.pdf">runtime partial
evaluator for Prolog</a>, to experiment with various specialization trade-offs. It
had an approach that we gave a not at all humble name, called "perfect
specialization".</p></li>
<li><p>The fifth JIT generator is the one that we are still using today. Instead of
generating a method-based JIT compiler from our interpreter we switched to
generating a tracing JIT compiler. Tracing JIT compilers were sort of the
latest fashion at the time, at least for a little while.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="meta-tracing">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="../posts/2018/09/the-first-15-years-of-pypy-3412615975376972020.html#id30">2009: Meta-Tracing</a></h1>
<p>So, how did that tracing JIT generator work? A <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_just-in-time_compilation">tracing JIT</a> generates code by
observing and logging the execution of the running program. This yields a
straight-line trace of operations, which are then optimized and compiled into
machine code.Â Of course most tracing systems mostly focus on tracing loops.</p>
<p>As we discovered, it's actually quite simple to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2009/03/applying-tracing-jit-to-interpreter.html">apply a tracing JIT to a generic
interpreter</a>, by not tracing the execution of the user program directly, but by
instead tracing the execution of the interpreter while it is running the user
program (here's the <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/extradoc/-/blob/branch/default/default/talk/icooolps2009/bolz-tracing-jit-final.pdf">paper</a> we wrote about this approach).</p>
<p>So that's what we implemented. Of course we kept the two successful parts of the
first JIT, <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/extradoc/-/blob/branch/default/default/talk/icooolps2011/bolz-hints-final.pdf">promote</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/extradoc/-/blob/branch/default/default/talk/pepm2011/escape-tracing.pdf">virtuals</a> (both links go to the papers about these
features in the meta-tracing context).</p>

<p>So one question I get sometimes asked when telling this story is, why did
we think that tracing would work better than partial evaluation (PE)? One of the
hardest parts of compilers in general and partial evaluation based systems in
particular is the decision when and how much to inline, how much to specialize,
as well as the decision when to split control flow paths. In the PE based JIT
generator we never managed to control that question. Either the JIT would
inline too much, leading to useless compilation of all kinds of unlikely error
cases. Or it wouldn't inline enough, preventing necessary optimizations.</p>
<p>Meta tracing solves this problem with a hammer, it doesn't make particularly
complex inlining decisions at all. It instead decides what to inline by
precisely following what a real execution through the program is doing. Its
inlining decisions are therefore very understandable and predictable, and it
basically only has one heuristic based on whether the called function contains a
loop or not: If the called function contains a loop, we'll never inline it, if
it doesn't we always try to inline it. That predictability is actually what was
the most helpful, since it makes it possible for interpreter authors to
understand why the JIT did what it did and to actually influence its inlining
decisions by changing the annotations in the interpreter source. It turns out
that simple is better than complex.</p>

<p>While we were writing all these JIT prototypes, PyPy had sort of reverted back
to being a volunteer-driven open source project (although some of us, like
Antonio Cuni and I, had started working for universities and other project
members had other sources of funding). But again, while we did the work it
became clear that to get an actually working fast PyPy with generated JIT we
would need actual funding again for the project. So we applied to the EU again,
this time for a much smaller project with less money, in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2010/12/oh-and-btw-pypy-gets-funding-through.html">Eurostars</a>
framework. We got a grant for three participants, <a class="reference external" href="https://merlinux.eu/">merlinux</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.openend.se/">OpenEnd</a> and Uni
DÃ¼sseldorf, on the order of a bit more than half a million euro. That money was

<p>When writing the grant we had sat together at a sprint and discussed extensively
and decided that we would not switch JIT generation approaches any more. We all
liked the tracing approach well enough and thought it was promising. So instead
we agreed to try in earnest to make the tracing JIT really practical. So in the
Eurostars project we started with implementing sort of fairly standard JIT
compiler optimizations for the meta-tracing JIT, such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>constant folding</p></li>
<li><p>dead code elimination</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/extradoc/-/blob/branch/default/default/talk/dls2012/dls04-ardo.pdf">loop invariant code motion</a> (using <a class="reference external" href="https://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2009-11/msg00089.html">LuaJIT's approach</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>better heap optimizations</p></li>
<li><p>faster deoptimization (which is actually a bit of a mess in the

<p>In 2010, to make sure that we wouldn't accidentally introduce speed regressions

<p>This actually leads me to something else that I'd say we learned, which is that
continuous integration is really awesome, and completely transformative to have
for a project. This is not a particularly surprising insight nowadays in the
open source community, it's easy to set up continuous integration on Github
using Travis or some other CI service. But I still see a lot of research
projects that don't have tests, that don't use CI, so I wanted to mention it
anyway. As I mentioned earlier in the post, PyPy has a quite serious testing
culture, with unit tests written for new code, regression tests for all bugs,
and integration tests using the CPython test suite. Those tests are <a class="reference external" href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/">run
nightly</a> on a number of architectures and operating systems.</p>
<p>Having all this kind of careful testing is of course necessary, since PyPy is
really trying to be a Python implementation that people actually use, not just
write papers about. But having all this infrastructure also had other benefits,
for example it allows us to trust newcomers to the project very quickly.
Basically after your first patch gets accepted, you immediately get commit
rights to the PyPy repository. If you screw up, the tests (or the code reviews)
are probably going to catch it, and that reduction to the barrier to
contributing is just super great.</p>
<p>This concludes my advertisement for testing in this post.</p>

<p>So, what else did we do in the Eurostars project, apart from adding traditional
compiler optimizations to the tracing JIT and setting up CI infrastructure?
Another strand of work, that went on sort of concurrently to the JIT generator
improvements, were deep rewrites in the Python runtime, and the Python data
structures. I am going to write about two exemplary ones here, maps and storage strategies.</p>
<p>The first such rewrite is fairly standard. Python instances are similar to
Javascript objects, in that you can add arbitrary attributes to them at runtime.
Originally Python instances were backed by a dictionary in PyPy, but of course
in practice most instances of the same class have the same set of attribute
names. Therefore we went and implemented <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2010/11/efficiently-implementing-python-objects.html">Self style maps</a>, which are often
called <a class="reference external" href="https://richardartoul.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/04/26/hidden-classes.html">hidden classes</a> in the JS world to represent instances instead. This
has two big benefits, it allows you to generate much better machine code for
instance attribute access and makes instances use a lot less memory.</p>

<p>Another important change in the PyPy runtime was rewriting the Python container
data structures, such as lists, dictionaries and sets. A fairly straightforward
observation about how those are used is that in a significant percentage of
cases they contain type-homogeneous data. As an example it's quite common to
have lists of only integers, or lists of only strings. So we changed the list,
dict and set implementations to use something we called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2011/10/more-compact-lists-with-list-strategies.html">storage strategies</a>. With
storage strategies these data structures use a more efficient representations if
they contain only primitives of the same type, such as ints, floats, strings.
This makes it possible to store the values without boxing them in the underlying
data structure. Therefore read and write access are much faster for such type
homogeneous containers. Of course when later another data type gets added to
such a list, the existing elements need to all be boxed at that point, which is
expensive. But we did a <a class="reference external" href="https://tratt.net/laurie/research/pubs/html/bolz_diekmann_tratt__storage_strategies_for_collections_in_dynamically_typed_languages/">study</a> and found out that that happens quite rarely in
practice. A lot of that work was done by Lukas Diekmann.</p>

<p>These two are just two examples for a number of fairly fundamental changes in
the PyPy runtime and PyPy data structures, probably the two most important ones,
but we did many others. That leads me to another thing we learned. If you want
to generate good code for a complex dynamic language such as Python, it's
actually not enough at all to have a good code generator and good compiler
optimizations. That's not going to help you, if your runtime data-structures
aren't in a shape where it's possible to generate efficient machine code to
access them.</p>
<p>Maybe this is well known in the VM and research community. However it's the main
mistake that in my opinion every other Python JIT effort has made in the last 10
years, where most projects said something along the lines of "we're not
changing the existing CPython data structures at all, we'll just let LLVM
inline enough C code of the runtime and then it will optimize all the overhead
away". That never works very well.</p>

<p>So, here we are at the end of the Eurostars project, what's the status of the JIT? Well, it
seems this meta-tracing stuff really works! We finally started actually
believing in it, when we reached the point in 2010 where self-hosting PyPy was
actually <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2010/11/snake-which-bites-its-tail-pypy-jitting.html">faster</a> than bootstrapping the VM on CPython. Speeding up the
bootstrapping process is something that Psyco never managed at all, so we
considered this a quite important achievement. At the end of
Eurostars, we were about 4x faster than CPython on our set of benchmarks.</p>

<p>2012 the Eurostars project was finished and PyPy reverted yet another time back
to be an open source project. From then on, we've had a more diverse set of
sources of funding: we received some crowd funding via the <a class="reference external" href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom
Conservancy</a> and contracts of various sizes from companies to implement various
specific features, often handled by <a class="reference external" href="https://baroquesoftware.com/">Baroque Software</a>. Over the next couple of
years
we revamped various parts of the VM. We improved the GC in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2013/10/incremental-garbage-collector-in-pypy.html">major</a> ways. We
optimized the implementation of the JIT compiler to improve <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2015/10/pypy-memory-and-warmup-improvements-2.html">warmup</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2016/04/warmup-improvements-more-efficient.html">times</a>. We
implemented backends for various CPU architectures (including <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2015/10/powerpc-backend-for-jit.html">PowerPC</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2016/04/pypy-enterprise-edition.html">s390x</a>). We tried to reduce the number of performance cliffs and make the JIT
useful in a broader set of cases.</p>
<p>Another strand of work was to push quite significantly to be more
compatible with CPython, particularly the Python 3 line as well as extension
module support. Other compatibility improvements we did was making sure that
virtualenv <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2010/08/using-virtualenv-with-pypy.html">works with PyPy</a>, better support for distutils and setuptools and
similar improvements. The continually improving performance as well better

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="../posts/2018/09/the-first-15-years-of-pypy-3412615975376972020.html#id41">CPyExt</a></h1>
<p>Another very important strand of work that took a lot of effort in recent years
was CPyExt. One of the main blockers of PyPy adoption had always been the fact
that a lot of people need specific C-extension modules at least in some parts of
their program, and telling them to reimplement everything in Python is just not
a practical solution. Therefore we worked on CPyExt, an emulation layer  to make
it possible to run <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2010/04/using-cpython-extension-modules-with.html">CPython C-extension modules</a> in PyPy. Doing that was a very
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH0eeh-4XE8">painful process</a>, since the CPython extension API leaks a lot of CPython
implementation details, so we had to painstakingly emulate all of these details
to make it possible to run extensions. That this works at all remains completely
amazing to me! But nowadays CPyExt is even getting quite good, a lot of the big
numerical libraries such as Numpy and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2017/10/pypy-v59-released-now-supports-pandas.html">Pandas</a> are now supported (for a while
we had worked hard on a reimplementation of Numpy called NumPyPy, but
eventually realized that it would never be complete and useful enough).
However, calling CPyExt modules from PyPy can still be very slow,
which makes it impractical for some applications
that's why we are <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2017/10/cape-of-good-hope-for-pypy-hello-from.html">working</a> on it.</p>
<p>Not thinking about C-extension module emulation earlier in the project history
was a pretty bad strategic mistake. It had been clear for a long time that
getting people to just stop using all their C-extension modules was never going
to work, despite our efforts to give them alternatives, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">cffi</a>. So we
should have thought of a story for all the existing C-extension modules earlier
in the project. Not starting CPyExt earlier was mostly a failure of our
imagination (and maybe a too high pain threshold): We didn't believe this kind
of emulation was going to be practical, until somebody <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/0c718ff5a3c1b583179325ab27b0d3b17fa11c0c">went and tried it</a>.</p>

<p>Another main
focus of the last couple of years has been to catch up with the CPython 3 line.
Originally we had ignored Python 3 for a little bit too long, and were trailing
several versions behind. In 2016 and 2017 we had a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2016/08/pypy-gets-funding-from-mozilla-for.html">grant</a> from the Mozilla open
source support program of $200'000 to be able to catch up with Python 3.5. This
work is now basically done, and we are starting to target CPython 3.6 and will
have to look into 3.7 in the near future.</p>

<p>So, what can be learned from those more recent years? One thing we can observe
is that a lot of the engineering work we did in that time is not really science
as such. A lot of the VM techniques we implemented are kind of well known, and
catching up with new Python features is also not particularly deep researchy
work. Of course this kind of work is obviously super necessary if you want
people to use your VM, but it would be very hard to try to get research funding
for it. PyPy managed quite well over its history to balance phases of more
research oriented work, and more product oriented ones. But getting this balance
somewhat right is not easy, and definitely also involves a lot of luck. And, as
has been discussed a lot, it's actually very hard to find funding for open
source work, both within and outside of academia.</p>

<p>Let me end with what, in my opinion, is the main positive technical result of PyPy the
project. Which is that the whole idea of using a meta-tracing JIT can really
work! Currently PyPy is about 7 times faster than CPython on a broad set of
benchmarks. Also, one of the very early motivations for using a meta-jitting
approach in PyPy, which was to not have to adapt the JIT to new versions of
CPython proved to work: indeed we didn't have to change anything in the JIT
infrastructure to support Python 3.</p>
<p>RPython has also worked and improved performance for a number of other
languages. Some of these interpreters had wildly different architectures.
AST-based interpreters, bytecode based, CPU emulators, really inefficient
high-level ones that allocate continuation objects all the time, and so on. This
shows that RPython also gives you a lot of freedom in deciding how you want to
structure the interpreter and that it can be applied to languages of quite
different paradigms.</p>
<p>I'll end with a list of the people that have contributed code to PyPy over its
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.openhub.net/p/pypy">history</a>, more than 350 of them. I'd like to thank all of them and the various
roles they played. To the next 15 years!</p>

<p>A lot of people helped me with this blog post. Tim Felgentreff made me give the
keynote, which lead me to start collecting the material. Samuele Pedroni
gave essential early input when I just started planning the talk, and also gave
feedback on the blog post. Maciej FijaÅ‚kowski gave me feedback on the post, in
particular important insight about the more recent years of the project. Armin
Rigo discussed the talk slides with me, and provided details about the early
expectations about the first JIT's hoped-for performance. Antonio Cuni gave
substantial feedback and many very helpful suggestions for the blog post.
Michael Hudson-Doyle also fixed a number of mistakes in the post and rightfully
complained about the lack of mention of the GC. Christian Tismer provided
access to his copy of early Python-de mailing list posts. Matti Picus pointed
out a number of things I had forgotten and fixed a huge number of typos and
awkward English, including my absolute inability to put commas correctly.
All remaining errors are of course my own.</p>

    <article class="markdown-body entry-content"><p>I watched the Hennessy &amp; Patterson's Turing award lecture recently:</p>



<p>In it, there's a slide comparing the performance of various matrix
multiplication implementations, using Python (presumably CPython) as a baseline
and comparing that against various C implementations (I couldn't find the
linked paper yet):</p>

<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jy_op9XTgH0/Wyo4IWrqNoI/AAAAAAAAh3w/bVrxPRSCHtY3AB8ITqe-QsqBYWCsGY7cQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/matmul.png"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jy_op9XTgH0/Wyo4IWrqNoI/AAAAAAAAh3w/bVrxPRSCHtY3AB8ITqe-QsqBYWCsGY7cQCPcBGAYYCw/s640/matmul.png" width="640"></a>

<p>I expected the baseline speedup of switching from CPython to C to be
higher and I also wanted to know what performance PyPy gets, so I did my own
benchmarks. This is a problem that Python is completely unsuited for, so it
should give very exaggerated results.</p>
<p>The usual <strong>disclaimers</strong> apply: All benchmarks are lies, benchmarking of
synthetic workloads even more so. My implementation is really naive (though I
did optimize it a little bit to help CPython), don't use any
of this <a href="https://gist.github.com/cfbolz/caa8299ebd5ab4e1203be1614a64bb54">code</a>
for anything real. The benchmarks ran on my rather old Intel i5-3230M laptop
under Ubuntu 17.10.</p>
<p>With that said, my results were as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Implementation</th>
<th align="right">time</th>
<th align="right">speedup over CPython</th>
<th align="right">speedup over PyPy</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>CPython</td>
<td align="right">512.588 Â± 2.362 s</td>
<td align="right">1 Ã—</td>
<td align="right"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PyPy</td>
<td align="right">8.167 Â± 0.007 s</td>
<td align="right">62.761 Â±  0.295 Ã—</td>
<td align="right">1 Ã—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'naive' C</td>
<td align="right">2.164 Â± 0.025 s</td>
<td align="right">236.817 Â±  2.918 Ã—</td>
<td align="right">3.773 Â± 0.044 Ã—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NumPy</td>
<td align="right">0.171 Â± 0.002 s</td>
<td align="right">2992.286 Â± 42.308 Ã—</td>
<td align="right">47.678 Â± 0.634 Ã—</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is running 1500x1500 matrix multiplications with (the same) random matrices. Every
implementation is run 50 times in a fresh process. The results are averaged,
the errors are bootstrapped 99% confidence intervals.</p>
<p>So indeed the speedup that I got of switching from CPython to C is quite a bit higher than
47x! PyPy is much better than CPython, but of course can't really compete
against GCC. And then the real professionals (numpy/OpenBLAS) are in a whole
'nother league. The speedup of the AVX numbers in the slide above is even
higher than my NumPy numbers, which I assume is the result of my old CPU with
two cores, vs. the 18 core CPU with AVX support.
Lesson confirmed: leave matrix multiplication to people who
actually know what they are doing.</p>

If you install any Cython-based module in PyPy 6.0.0, it is very likely that you get a warning like this:</div>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy
/data/extra/pypy/6.0.0/site-packages/numpy/random/__init__.py:99: UserWarning: __builtin__.type size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 888, got 408
  from .mtrand import *
</code></pre>
<div>
The TL;DR version is: the warning is a false alarm, and you can hide it by doing:</div>
<pre><code>$ pypy -m pip install pypy-fix-cython-warning
</code></pre>
<div>
The package does not contain any module, only aÂ <code>.pth</code>Â file which installs a warning filter at startup.</div>
<h2>
Technical details</h2>
<div>
This happens because whenever Cython compiles a pyx file, it generates C code which does a sanity check on the C size ofÂ <code>PyType_Type</code>. PyPy versions up to 5.10 are buggy and report the incorrect size, so Cython includes a workaround to compare it with the incorrect value, when on PyPy.</div>
<div>
PyPy 6 fixed the bug and nowÂ <code>PyType_Type</code>Â reports the correct size; however, Cython still tries to compare it with the old, buggy value, so it (wrongly) emits the warning.</div>
<div>
Cython 0.28.2 includes a fix for it, so that C files generated by it no longer emit the warning. However, most packages are distributed with pre-cythonized C files. For example,Â <code>numpy-1.14.2.zip</code>Â include C files which were generated by Cython 0.26.1: if you compile it you still get the warning, even if you locally installed a newer version of Cython.<br><span style="color: #24292e;"><br></span>
<span style="color: #24292e;">There is not much that we can do on the PyPy side, apart for waiting for all the Cython-based packages to do a new release which include C files generated by a newer Cython.Â  In the mean time, installing this module will silence theÂ </span><span style="color: #24292e;">warning.</span>

The PyPy team is proud to release both PyPy2.7 v6.0 (an interpreter supporting
Python 2.7 syntax), and a PyPy3.5 v6.0 (an interpreter supporting Python
3.5 syntax). The two releases are both based on much the same codebase, thus
the dual release.<br>
This release is a feature release following our previous 5.10 incremental
release in late December 2017. Our C-API compatibility layer <b><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cpyext</span></code></b> is
now much faster (see the <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2017/10/cape-of-good-hope-for-pypy-hello-from-3656631725712879033.html">blog post</a>) as well as more complete. We have made
many other improvements in speed and CPython compatibility. Since the changes
affect the included python development header files, all c-extension modules must
be recompiled for this version.<br>
Until we can work with downstream providers to distribute builds with PyPy, we
have made packages for some common packages <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antocuni/pypy-wheels">available as wheels</a>. You may
compile yourself using <b><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">--no-build-isolation</span> <span class="pre">&lt;package&gt;</span></code></b>, the
<b><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">no-build-isolation</span></code></b> is currently needed for pip v10.<br>
First-time python users are often stumped by silly typos and omissions when
getting started writing code. We have improved our parser to emit more friendly
<a class="reference external" href="../posts/2018/04/improving-syntaxerror-in-pypy-5733639208090522433.html">syntax errors</a>,  making PyPy not only faster but more friendly.<br>
The GC now has <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/gc_info.html#gc-hooks">hooks</a> to gain more insights into its performance<br>
The default Matplotlib TkAgg backend now works with PyPy, as do pygame and <a class="reference external" href="https://lazka.github.io/posts/2018-04_pypy-pygobject/index.html">pygobject</a>.<br>
We updated the <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/">cffi</a> module included in PyPy to version 1.11.5, and the
<a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/">cppyy</a> backend to 0.6.0. Please use these to wrap your C and C++ code,
respectively, for a JIT friendly experience.<br>
As always, this release is 100% compatible with the previous one and fixed
several issues and bugs raised by the growing community of PyPy users.
We strongly recommend updating.<br>
The Windows PyPy3.5 release is still considered beta-quality. There are open
issues with unicode handling especially around system calls and c-extensions.<br>
The utf8 branch that changes internal representation of unicode to utf8 did not
make it into the release, so there is still more goodness coming. We also
began working on a Python3.6 implementation, help is welcome.<br>

What is PyPy?</h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7 and CPython 3.5. Itâ€™s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.<br>
The PyPy release supports:<br><blockquote>
<div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>newer <b>ARM</b> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux,</li>

    <p>For the last year, my halftime job has been to teach non-CS uni students
to program in Python. While doing that, I have been trying to see what common
stumbling blocks exist for novice programmers. There are many
things that could be said here, but a common theme that emerges is
hard-to-understand error messages. One source of such error messages,
particularly when starting out, is <tt class="docutils literal">SyntaxErrors</tt>.</p>
<p>PyPy's parser (mostly following the architecture of CPython) uses a
regular-expression-based tokenizer with some cleverness to deal with
indentation, and a simple LR(1) parser. Both of these components obviously
produce errors for invalid syntax, but the messages are not very helpful. Often,
the message is just "invalid syntax", without any hint of what exactly is wrong.
In the last couple of weeks I have invested a little bit of effort to make them a
tiny bit better. They will be part of the upcoming PyPy 6.0 release. Here are
some examples of what changed.</p>
<div class="section" id="missing-characters">
<h1>Missing Characters</h1>
<p>The first class of errors occurs when a token is missing, often there is only one
valid token that the parser expects. This happens most commonly by leaving out
the ':' after control flow statements (which is the syntax error I personally
still make at least a few times a day). In such situations, the parser will now
tell you which character it expected:</p>
<pre class="code pycon literal-block">
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if 1
</span><span class="generic traceback"></span>  File <span class="name builtin">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="literal number">1</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="literal number integer">1</span>
       <span class="operator">^</span>
<span class="generic error">SyntaxError</span>: <span class="name">invalid syntax</span>
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if 1
</span><span class="generic traceback"></span>  File <span class="name builtin">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="literal number">1</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="literal number integer">1</span>
       <span class="operator">^</span>
<span class="generic error">SyntaxError</span>: <span class="name">invalid syntax (expected ':')</span>
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>Another example of this feature:</p>
<pre class="code pycon literal-block">
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; def f:
</span><span class="generic traceback"></span>  File <span class="name builtin">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="literal number">1</span>
    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">f</span><span class="punctuation">:</span>
        <span class="operator">^</span>
<span class="generic error">SyntaxError</span>: <span class="name">invalid syntax</span>
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; def f:
</span><span class="generic traceback"></span>  File <span class="name builtin">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="literal number">1</span>
    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">f</span><span class="punctuation">:</span>
         <span class="operator">^</span>
<span class="generic error">SyntaxError</span>: <span class="name">invalid syntax (expected '(')</span>
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parentheses">
<h1>Parentheses</h1>
<p>Another source of errors are unmatched parentheses. Here, PyPy has always had
slightly better error messages than CPython:</p>
<pre class="code pycon literal-block">
<span class="comment single"></span><span class="generic prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="comment single"># CPython</span>
<span class="generic prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
<span class="generic traceback"></span>  File <span class="name builtin">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="literal number">1</span>
    <span class="punctuation">)</span>
    <span class="operator">^</span>
<span class="generic error">SyntaxError</span>: <span class="name">invalid syntax</span>
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # PyPy
</span><span class="punctuation"></span><span class="generic prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
<span class="generic traceback"></span>  File <span class="name builtin">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="literal number">1</span>
    <span class="punctuation">)</span>
    <span class="operator">^</span>
<span class="generic error">SyntaxError</span>: <span class="name">unmatched ')'</span>
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>The same is true for parentheses that are never closed (the call to <tt class="docutils literal">eval</tt> is
needed to get the error, otherwise the repl will just wait for more input):</p>
<pre class="code pycon literal-block">
<span class="comment single"></span><span class="generic prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="comment single"># CPython</span>
<span class="generic prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="name builtin">eval</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="literal string single">'('</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
<span class="generic traceback"></span>  File <span class="name builtin">"&lt;string&gt;"</span>, line <span class="literal number">1</span>
    <span class="punctuation">(</span>
    <span class="operator">^</span>
<span class="generic error">SyntaxError</span>: <span class="name">unexpected EOF while parsing</span>
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # PyPy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eval('(')
</span><span class="generic traceback"></span>  File <span class="name builtin">"&lt;string&gt;"</span>, line <span class="literal number">1</span>
    <span class="punctuation">(</span>
    <span class="operator">^</span>
<span class="generic error">SyntaxError</span>: <span class="name">parenthesis is never closed</span>
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>What I have now improved is the case of parentheses that are matched wrongly:</p>
<pre class="code pycon literal-block">
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (1,
.... 2,
.... ]
</span><span class="generic traceback"></span>  File <span class="name builtin">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="literal number">3</span>
    <span class="punctuation">]</span>
    <span class="operator">^</span>
<span class="generic error">SyntaxError</span>: <span class="name">invalid syntax</span>
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (1,
.... 2,
.... ]
</span><span class="generic traceback"></span>  File <span class="name builtin">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="literal number">3</span>
    <span class="punctuation">]</span>
    <span class="operator">^</span>
<span class="generic error">SyntaxError</span>: <span class="name">closing parenthesis ']' does not match opening parenthesis '(' on line 1</span>
<span class="generic output">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Obviously these are just some very simple cases, and there is still a lot of
room for improvement (one huge problem is that only a single <tt class="docutils literal">SyntaxError</tt> is
ever shown per parse attempt, but fixing that is rather hard).</p>
<p>If you have a favorite unhelpful SyntaxError message you love to hate, please
tell us in the comments and we might try to improve it. Other kinds of
non-informative error messages are also always welcome!</p>

          <p>Missing commas between elements in data structures is probably my most common syntax error, especially when dealing with nested data structures or structures split across multiple lines.

          <p>Thanks for the explanation. It all makes sense now that I know Python uses regular expressions in its parser. When Idle points to a random space character within the indentation, off to the left of a code block implemented in compliance with every recognized convention, boldly proclaiming "syntax error", I know precisely which vestigial anti-Pythonic Bell Labs holdover to resent.

          <p>Sorry for the 'unknown' status ... In fact, it happened again today.

Let me see if it is still happening when I try to run that code ... No, that exact SNAFU has moved on, but I now have an example of a syntax error being highlighted within a comment. Is that interesting?<br></p>

          <p>I would love to see this get updated to Python 3.6.5. I'm currently using that for my programs, and even after looking at the changelogs between Python versions, I'm not sure what I'd lose by moving down to 3.5.3 so that I could use PyPy.<br><br>I'm also curious about things like IdleX and Anaconda.

    <p>Like every year, the PyPy developers and a couple of newcomers
      gathered in Leysin, Switzerland, to share their thoughts and
      contribute to the development of PyPy.</p>
    <p>As always, we had interesting discussions about how we could
      improve PyPy, to make it the first choice for even more
      developers. We also made some progress with current issues, like
      compatibility with Python 3.6 and improving the performance of
      CPython extension modules, where we fixed a lot of bugs and gained
      new insights about where and how we could tweak PyPy.<br></p>
    <p> We were very happy about the number of new people who joined us
      for the first time, and hope they enjoyed it as much as everyone
      else. <br></p>
    <h3>Topics</h3>
    We worked on the following topics (and more!):<br><ul>
<li>Introductions for newcomers</li>
      <li>Python 3.5 and 3.6 improvements</li>
      <li>CPyExt performance improvements and GC implementation<br>
</li>
      <li>JIT: guard-compatible implementation<br>
</li>
      <li>Pygame performance improvements</li>
      <li>Unicode/UTF8 implementation<br>
</li>
      <li>CFFI tutorial/overview rewrite
      </li>
      <li>py3 test runners refactoring</li>
      <li>RevDB improvements<br>
</li>
    </ul>
    The weather was really fine for most of the week, with only
    occasional snow and fog. We started our days with a short (and
    sometimes not so short) planning session and enjoyed our dinners in
    the great restaurants in the area. Some of us even started earlier
    and continued till late night. It was a relaxed, but also very
    productive atmosphere. On our break day on Wednesday, we enjoyed the
    great conditions and went skiing and hiking.

We have released a bug fix PyPy3.5-v5.10.1
due to the following issues:<br><blockquote>
<div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fix <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">time.sleep(float('nan'))</span></code> which would hang on Windows</li>
<li>Fix missing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">errno</span></code> constants on Windows</li>

<li>Fix an overflow in converting int secs to nanosecs (issue <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/2717">2717</a> )</li>
<li>Using kwarg <span><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'flag'</span></code></span> to <span><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">os.setxattr</span></code></span> had no effect</li>
<li>Fix the winreg module for unicode entries in the registry on Windows</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
Note that many of these fixes are for our new beta version of PyPy3.5 on Windows. There may be more unicode problems in the Windows beta version,
especially concerning directory- and file-names with non-ASCII
characters.<br><br>
On macOS, we recommend you wait for the
<a class="reference external" href="https://brewformulas.org/Pypy">Homebrew</a> package to prevent issues with third-party packages. For other supported platforms our <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads">downloads</a> are available now.<br>
Thanks to those who reported the issues.<br><br><div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h2>
What is PyPy?</h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7 and CPython 3.5. Itâ€™s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>

We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.<br>

This PyPy 3.5 release supports:<br><blockquote>
<div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, macOS 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>newer <strong>ARM</strong> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux,</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <strong>PPC64</strong> running Linux,</li>
<li>
<strong>s390x</strong> running Linux</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
Please update, and continue to help us make PyPy better.<br>

Cheers<br>

<p>The PyPy team is proud to release both PyPy2.7 v5.10 (an interpreter supporting
Python 2.7 syntax), and a final PyPy3.5 v5.10 (an interpreter for Python
3.5 syntax). The two releases are both based on much the same codebase, thus
the dual release.</p>
<p>This release is an incremental release with very few new features, the main
feature being the final PyPy3.5 release that works on linux and OS X with beta
windows support. It also includes fixes for <a class="reference external" href="https://vmprof.readthedocs.io">vmprof</a> cooperation with greenlets.</p>
<p>Compared to 5.9, the 5.10 release contains mostly bugfixes and small improvements.
We have in the pipeline big new features coming for PyPy 6.0 that did not make
the release cut and should be available within the next couple months.</p>
<p>As always, this release is 100% compatible with the previous one and fixed
several issues and bugs raised by the growing community of PyPy users.
As always, we strongly recommend updating.</p>
<p>There are quite a few important changes that are in the pipeline that did not
make it into the 5.10 release. Most important are speed improvements to cpyext
(which will make numpy and pandas a bit faster) and utf8 branch that changes
internal representation of unicode to utf8, which should help especially the
Python 3.5 version of PyPy.</p>
<p>This release concludes the Mozilla Open Source <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2016/08/pypy-gets-funding-from-mozilla-for-5569307998787871200.html">grant</a> for having a compatible
PyPy 3.5 release and we're very grateful for that.  Of course, we will continue
to improve PyPy 3.5 and probably move to 3.6 during the course of 2018.</p>
