    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>A short note: if you're at EuroPython right now and wondering if PyPy is
dead because you don't see the obviously expected talk about PyPy, don't
worry.  PyPy is still alive and kicking.  The truth is two-fold: (1) we
missed the talk deadline (duh!)... but as importantly, (2) for various
reasons we chose not to travel to Florence this year after our trip to
PyCon US.  (Antonio Cuni is at Florence but doesn't have a talk about PyPy
either.)</p>

    <p>This is the 11th status update about our work on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/all/tip/branch%28%22py3k%22%29">py3k branch</a>, which we<br>
can work on thanks to all of the people who <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2012/01/py3k-and-numpy-first-stage-thanks-to-3008917396290059758.html">donated</a> to the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/py3donate.html">py3k proposal</a>.</p>
<p>Here's some highlights of the progress made since the previous update:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyPy py3k now matches CPython 3's hash code for<br>
int/float/complex/Decimal/Fraction</li>
<li>Various outstanding unicode identifier related issues were<br>
resolved. E.g. test_importlib/pep263/ucn/unicode all now fully pass. Various<br>
usage of identifiers (in particular type and module names) have been fixed to<br>
handle non-ascii names -- mostly around display of reprs and exception<br>
messages.</li>
<li>The unicodedata database has been upgraded to 6.0.0.</li>
<li>Windows support has greatly improved, though it could still use some more<br>
help (but so does the default branch to a certain degree).</li>
<li>Probably the last of the parsing related bugs/features have been taken care<br>
of.</li>
<li>Of course various other smaller miscellaneous fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>This leaves the branch w/ only about 5 outstanding failures of the stdlib test<br>
suite:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first">test_float</p>
<p>1 failing test about containment of floats in collections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">test_memoryview</p>
<p>Various failures: requires some bytes/str changes among other things (Manuel<br>
Jacob's has some progress on this on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/compare/py3k-memoryview..py3k">py3k-memoryview branch</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">test_multiprocessing</p>
<p>1 or more tests deadlock on some platforms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">test_sys and test_threading</p>
<p>2 failing tests for the New GIL's new API</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably the biggest feature left to tackle is the New GIL.</p>
<p>We're now pretty close to pushing an initial release. We had planned for one<br>
around PyCon, but having missed that we've put some more effort into the branch<br>
to provide a more fully-fledged initial release.</p>
<p>Thanks to the following for their contributions: Manuel Jacob, Amaury Forgeot<br>
d'Arc, Karl Ramm, Jason Chu and Christian Hudon.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>
Phil</p>

    <p>Hi all!</p>

<p>This is an update about the Software Transactional Memory subproject of
PyPy.  I have some good news of progress.  Also,
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/Raemi">Remi Meier</a> will
likely help me this summer.  He did various
investigations with PyPy-STM for his Master's Thesis and contributed back
a lot of ideas and some code.  Welcome again Remi!</p>

<p>I am also sorry that it seems to advance so slowly.  Beyond the usual
excuses --- I was busy with other things, e.g. releasing PyPy 2.0 --- I
would like to reassure people: I'm again working on it, and the financial
contributions are still there and reserved for STM (almost half the money is
left, a big thank you again if you contributed!).</p>

<p>The real reason for the apparent slowness, though, is that it is really
a research project.  It's possible to either have hard deadlines, or to
follow various tracks and keep improving the basics, but not both at the
same time.</p>

<p>During the past month where I have worked again on STM, I worked still on
the second option; and I believe it was worth every second of it.  Let me try
to convince you :-)</p>

<p>The main blocker was that the STM subsystem, written in C, and the
Garbage Collection (GC) subsystem, written in RPython, were getting
harder and harder to coordinate.  So what I did instead is to give up
using RPython in favor of using only C for both.  C is a good language
for some things, which includes low-level programming where we must take
care of delicate multithreading issues; RPython is not a good fit in
that case, and wasn't designed to be.</p>

<p>I started a fresh <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/stmgc">Mercurial repo</a>
which is basically a stand-alone C library.  This library (in heavy development
right now!) gives any C
program some functions to allocate and track GC-managed objects, and
gives an actual STM+GC combination on these objects.  It's possible
(though rather verbose) to use it directly in C programs, like in a
small example interpreter.  Of course the eventual purpose is to link it
with PyPy during translation to C, with all the verbose calls
automatically generated.</p>

<p>Since I started this, bringing the GC closer to the STM, I kept finding
new ways that the two might interact to improve the performance, maybe
radically.  Here is a summary of the current ideas.</p>

<p>When we run
multiple threads, there are two common cases: one is to access (read and write)
objects that have only been seen by the current thread; the other is to read
objects seen by all threads, like in Python the modules/functions/classes,
but not to write to them.  Of course, writing to the same object from
multiple threads occurs too, and it is handled correctly (that's the whole
point), but it is a relatively rare case.</p>

<p>So each object is classified as "public" or "protected" (or "private",
when they belong to the current transaction).  Newly created objects, once
they are no longer private, remain protected until
they are read by a different thread.  Now, the point is to use very
different mechanisms for public and for protected objects.  Public
objects are visible by all threads, but read-only in memory; to change
them, a copy must be made, and the changes are written to the copy (the
"redolog" approach to STM).  Protected objects, on the other hand, are
modified in-place, with (if necessary) a copy of them being made
for the sole purpose of a possible abort of the transaction (the "undolog"
approach).</p>

<p>This is combined with a generational GC similar to PyPy's --- but here,
each thread gets its own nursery and does its own "minor collections",
independently of the others.</p>

<p>So objects are by default protected; when another thread tries to follow a
pointer to them, then it is that other thread's job to carefully "steal"
the object and turn it public (possibly making a copy of it if needed,
e.g. if it was still a young object living in the original nursery).</p>

<p>The same object can exist temporarily in multiple versions: any number
of public copies; at most one active protected copy; and optionally one
private copy per thread (this is the copy as currently seen by the
transaction in progress on that thread).  The GC cleans up the
unnecessary copies.</p>

<p>These ideas are variants and extensions of the same basic idea
of keeping multiple copies with revision numbers to track them.
Moreover, "read barriers" and "write barriers" are used by the C program
calling into this library in order to be sure that it is accessing the
right version of the object.  In the currently investigated variant
I believe it should be possible to have rather cheap
read barriers, which would definitely be a major speed improvement over
the previous variants.  Actually, as far as I know, it would be a major
improvement over most of the other existing STMs: in them, the typical read barrier
involves following chains of pointers, and checking some dictionary to see if this
thread has a modified local copy of the object.  The difference with a
read barrier that can resolve most cases in a few CPU cycles should be
huge.</p>

<p>So, this is research :-)  It is progressing, and at some point I'll be
satisfied with it and stop rewriting everything; and then the actual
integration into PyPy should be straightforward (there is already code
to detect where the read and write barriers need to be inserted, where
transactions can be split, etc.).  Then there is support for the
JIT to be written, and so on.  But more about it later.</p>

<p>The purpose of this post was to give you some glimpses into what I'm
working on right now.  As usual, no plan for release yet.  But you can
look forward to seeing the C library progress.  I'll probably also start
soon some sample interpreter in C, to test the waters (likely a
revival of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/arigo/duhton">duhton</a>).
If you know nothing about Python but all about the C-level
multithreading issues, now is a good time to get involved :-)</p>

    <p>Hello everyone,<br><br>
May was the first month I was paid to work on NumPyPy (thanks to all who donated!), here is what I worked on during this period :<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to use subarrays.</li>
<li>It is now possible to pickle ndarrays (including those using subarrays), dtypes and scalars, the pickling protocol is the same as numpy's.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
For June, I plan to work on the nditer class, it seems that there's enough work for an entire month.</div>
<br>
Cheers<br>

<ul class="simple">
<li>your program is multithreaded;</li>

    <p>Hello Everyone,<br><br>
I've started to work on NumPyPy since the end of April and here is a short update :<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>I implemented pickling support on ndarrays and dtypes, it will be compatible with numpy's pickling protocol when the "numpypy" module will be renamed to "numpy".</li>
<li>I am now working on subarrays.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're pleased to announce PyPy 2.0. This is a stable release that brings
a swath of bugfixes, small performance improvements and compatibility fixes.
PyPy 2.0 is a big step for us and we hope in the future we'll be able to
provide stable releases more often.</p>
<p>You can download the PyPy 2.0 release here:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/download.html">https://pypy.org/download.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>The two biggest changes since PyPy 1.9 are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>stackless is now supported including greenlets, which means eventlet
and gevent should work (but read below about gevent)</li>
<li>PyPy now contains release 0.6 of <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org">cffi</a> as a builtin module, which
is preferred way of calling C from Python that works well on PyPy</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're using PyPy for anything, it would help us immensely if you fill out
the following survey: <a class="reference external" href="https://bit.ly/pypysurvey">https://bit.ly/pypysurvey</a> This is for the developers
eyes and we will not make any information public without your agreement.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h3>What is PyPy?</h3>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">pypy 2.0 and cpython 2.7.3</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>This release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64 or
Windows 32.  Windows 64 work is still stalling, we would welcome a volunteer
to handle that. ARM support is on the way, as you can see from the recently
released alpha for ARM.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="highlights">
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Stackless including greenlets should work. For gevent, you need to check
out <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gevent-on-pypy/pypycore/">pypycore</a> and use the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/schmir/gevent/tree/pypy-hacks">pypy-hacks</a> branch of gevent.</li>
<li>cffi is now a module included with PyPy.  (<a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org">cffi</a> also exists for
CPython; the two versions should be fully compatible.)  It is the
preferred way of calling C from Python that works on PyPy.</li>
<li>Callbacks from C are now JITted, which means XML parsing is much faster.</li>
<li>A lot of speed improvements in various language corners, most of them small,
but speeding up some particular corners a lot.</li>
<li>The JIT was refactored to emit machine code which manipulates a "frame"
that lives on the heap rather than on the stack.  This is what makes
Stackless work, and it could bring another future speed-up (not done yet).</li>
<li>A lot of stability issues fixed.</li>
<li>Refactoring much of the numpypy array classes, which resulted in removal of
lazy expression evaluation. On the other hand, we now have more complete
dtype support and support more array attributes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>We're pleased to announce an alpha release of PyPy 2.0 for ARM. This is mostly
a technology preview, as we know the JIT is not yet stable enough for the
full release. However please try your stuff on ARM and report back.</p>
<p>This is the first release that supports a range of ARM devices - anything with
ARMv6 (like the Raspberry Pi) or ARMv7 (like Beagleboard, Chromebook,
Cubieboard, etc.) that supports VFPv3 should work. We provide builds with
support for both ARM EABI variants: hard-float and some older operating
systems soft-float.</p>
<p>This release comes with a list of limitations, consider it alpha quality,
not suitable for production:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>stackless support is missing.</li>
<li>assembler produced is not always correct, but we successfully managed to
run large parts of our extensive benchmark suite, so most stuff should work.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download the PyPy 2.0 alpha ARM release here (including a deb for raspbian):</p>

<a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/download.html">https://pypy.org/download.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of the work was sponsored by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi foundation</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h3>What is PyPy?</h3>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7.3. It's fast due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>This release supports ARM machines running Linux 32bit. Both hard-float
<tt class="docutils literal">armhf</tt> and soft-float <tt class="docutils literal">armel</tt> builds are provided.  <tt class="docutils literal">armhf</tt> builds are
created using the Raspberry Pi custom <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/raspberrypi">cross-compilation toolchain</a> based on
gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf and should work on ARMv6 and ARMv7 devices running at
least debian or ubuntu. <tt class="docutils literal">armel</tt> builds are built using gcc-arm-linux-gnuebi
toolchain provided by ubuntu and currently target ARMv7.  If there is interest
in other builds, such as gnueabi for ARMv6 or without requiring a VFP let us
know in the comments or in IRC.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benchmarks">
<h3>Benchmarks</h3>
<p>Everybody loves benchmarks. Here is a table of our benchmark suite
(for ARM we don't provide it yet on <a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">https://speed.pypy.org</a>,
unfortunately).</p>
<p>This is a comparison of Cortex A9 processor with 4M cache and Xeon W3580 with
8M of L3 cache. The set of benchmarks is a subset of what we run for
<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">https://speed.pypy.org</a> that finishes in reasonable time. The ARM machine
was provided by Calxeda.
Columns are respectively:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>benchmark name</li>
<li>PyPy speedup over CPython on ARM (Cortex A9)</li>
<li>PyPy speedup over CPython on x86 (Xeon)</li>
<li>speedup on Xeon vs Cortex A9, as measured on CPython</li>
<li>speedup on Xeon vs Cortex A9, as measured on PyPy</li>
<li>relative speedup (how much bigger the x86 speedup is over ARM speedup)</li>

<p>It seems that Cortex A9, while significantly slower than Xeon, has higher
slowdowns with a large interpreter (CPython) than a JIT compiler (PyPy). This
comes as a surprise to me, especially that our ARM assembler is not nearly
as polished as our x86 assembler. As for the causes, various people mentioned
branch predictor, but I would not like to speculate without actually knowing.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-to-use-pypy">
<h3>How to use PyPy?</h3>
<p>We suggest using PyPy from a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>. Once you have a virtualenv
installed, you can follow instructions from <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-using-virtualenv">pypy documentation</a> on how
to proceed. This document also covers other <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-pypy">installation schemes</a>.</p>
<p>We would not recommend using in production PyPy on ARM just quite yet,
however the day of a stable PyPy ARM release is not far off.</p>

    <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
<p>We're pleased to announce the 2.0 beta 2 release of PyPy. This is a major
release of PyPy and we're getting very close to 2.0 final, however it includes
quite a few new features that require further testing. Please test and report
issues, so we can have a rock-solid 2.0 final. It also includes a performance
regression of about 5% compared to 2.0 beta 1 that we hope to fix before
2.0 final. The ARM support is not working yet and we're working hard to
make it happen before the 2.0 final. The new major features are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>JIT now supports stackless features, that is greenlets and stacklets. This
means that JIT can now optimize the code that switches the context. It enables
running <a class="reference external" href="https://eventlet.net/">eventlet</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gevent.org/">gevent</a> on PyPy (although gevent requires some
special support that's not quite finished, read below).</li>
<li>This is the first PyPy release that includes <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.6/">cffi</a> as a core library.
Version 0.6 comes included in the PyPy library. cffi has seen a lot of
adoption among library authors and we believe it's the best way to wrap
C libaries. You can see examples of cffi usage in <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/aefddd47f224e3c12e2ea74f5c796d76f4355bdb/lib_pypy/_curses.py?at=default">_curses.py</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/aefddd47f224e3c12e2ea74f5c796d76f4355bdb/lib_pypy/_sqlite3.py?at=default">_sqlite3.py</a> in the PyPy source code.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download the PyPy 2.0 beta 2 release here:</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h3>What is PyPy?</h3>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7.3. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">pypy 2.0 beta 2 and cpython 2.7.3</a>
performance comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>This release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64 or
Windows 32. It also supports ARM machines running Linux, however this is
disabled for the beta 2 release.
Windows 64 work is still stalling, we would welcome a volunteer
to handle that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-use-pypy">
<h3>How to use PyPy?</h3>
<p>We suggest using PyPy from a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>. Once you have a virtualenv
installed, you can follow instructions from <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-using-virtualenv">pypy documentation</a> on how
to proceed. This document also covers other <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-pypy">installation schemes</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="highlights">
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">cffi</tt> is officially supported by PyPy. It comes included in the standard
library, just use <tt class="docutils literal">import cffi</tt>
</li>
<li>stackless support - <a class="reference external" href="https://eventlet.net/">eventlet</a> just works and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gevent.org/">gevent</a> requires <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gevent-on-pypy/pypycore">pypycore</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/schmir/gevent/tree/pypy-hacks">pypy-hacks</a> branch of gevent (which mostly disables cython-based
modules)</li>
<li>callbacks from C are now much faster. pyexpat is about 3x faster, cffi
callbacks around the same</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">__length_hint__</tt> is implemented (PEP 424)</li>
<li>a lot of numpy improvements</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improvements-since-1-9">
<h3>Improvements since 1.9</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/jit-hooks.html">JIT hooks</a> are now a powerful tool to introspect the JITting process that
PyPy performs</li>
<li>various performance improvements compared to 1.9 and 2.0 beta 1</li>
<li>operations on <tt class="docutils literal">long</tt> objects are now as fast as in CPython (from
roughly 2x slower)</li>
<li>we now have special strategies for <tt class="docutils literal">dict</tt>/<tt class="docutils literal">set</tt>/<tt class="docutils literal">list</tt> which contain
unicode strings, which means that now such collections will be both faster
and more compact.</li>
