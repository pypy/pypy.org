    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>We released <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org">CFFI 0.3</a>.  This is the first release that supports more
than CPython 2.x <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:-)</span></tt></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CPython 2.6, 2.7, and <strong>3.x</strong> are supported (3.3 definitely, but maybe 3.2 or earlier too)</li>
<li>
<strong>PyPy trunk</strong> is supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>In more details, the main news are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>support for PyPy.  You need to get a trunk version of PyPy, which
comes with the built-in module <tt class="docutils literal">_cffi_backend</tt> to use with the CFFI
release.  For testing, you can download the <a class="reference external" href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/">Linux 32/64 versions of
PyPy trunk</a>.  The OS/X and Windows versions of <tt class="docutils literal">_cffi_backend</tt>
are not tested at all so far, so probably don't work yet.</li>
<li>support for Python 3.  It is unknown which exact version is
required; probably 3.2 or even earlier, but we need 3.3 to run the
tests.  The 3.x version is not a separate source; it runs out of the same sources.  Thanks Amaury for starting this port.</li>
<li>the main change in the API is that you need to use <tt class="docutils literal">ffi.string(cdata)</tt>
instead of <tt class="docutils literal">str(cdata)</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">unicode(cdata)</tt>.  The motivation for this
change was the Python 3 compatibility.  If your Python 2 code used to
contain <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">str(&lt;cdata</span> 'char <span class="pre">*'&gt;)</span></tt>, it would interpret the memory content
as a null-terminated string; but on Python 3 it would just return a
different string, namely <tt class="docutils literal">"&lt;cdata 'char <span class="pre">*'&gt;"</span></tt>, and proceed without even
a crash, which is bad.  So ffi.string() solves it by always returning
the memory content as an 8-bit string (which is a str in Python 2 and
a bytes in Python 3).</li>
<li>other minor API changes are documented at
<a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org/">https://cffi.readthedocs.org/</a> (grep for <tt class="docutils literal">version 0.3</tt>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming work, to be done before release 1.0:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>expose to the user the module <tt class="docutils literal">cffi.model</tt> in a possibly refactored
way, for people that don't like (or for some reason can't easily use)
strings containing snippets of C declarations.  We are thinking about
refactoring it in such a way that it has a ctypes-compatible
interface, to ease porting existing code from ctypes to cffi.  Note
that this would concern only the C type and function declarations, not
all the rest of ctypes.</li>
<li>CFFI 1.0 will also have a corresponding PyPy release.  We are thinking
about calling it PyPy 2.0 and including the whole of CFFI (instead of
just the <tt class="docutils literal">_cffi_backend</tt> module like now).  In other words it will
support CFFI out of the box --- we want to push forward usage of CFFI
in PyPy <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:-)</span></tt>
</li>
</ul>

    <p>The cppyy module makes it possible to call into C++ from PyPy through the
<a href="https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/reflex">Reflex package</a>.
Documentation and setup instructions are
<a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cppyy.html">available here</a>.
Recent work has focused on STL, low-level buffers, and code quality, but also
a lot on pythonizations for the
<a href="https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cint">CINT backend</a>, which is
mostly for High Energy Physics (HEP) use only.
A
<a href="../posts/2012/06/architecture-of-cppyy-9077100041707701102.html">previous posting</a> walked
through the high-level structure and organization of the module, where it was
argued why it is necessary to write cppyy in RPython and generate bindings at
run-time for the best performance.
This posting details how access to C++ data structures is provided and is part
of a series of 3 postings on C++ object representation in Python: the second
posting will be about method dispatching, the third will tie up several odds
and ends by showing how the choices presented here and in part 2 work together
to make features such as auto-casting possible.


</p>
<h3>Wrapping Choices</h3>

<p>Say we have a plain old data type (POD), which is the simplest possible
data structure in C++.
Like for example:

</p>
<pre>    struct A {
        int    m_i;
        double m_d;
    };</pre>

<p>What should such a POD look like when represented in Python?
Let's start by looking at a Python data structure that is functionally
similar, in that it also carries two public data members of the desired
types.
Something like this:

</p>
<pre>    class A(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.m_i = 0
            self.m_d = 0.</pre>

<p>Alright, now how to go about connecting this Python class with the former
C++ POD?
Or rather, how to connect instances of either.
The exact memory layout of a Python
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>
instance is up to Python, and likewise the layout of a C++
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> instance is up
to C++.
Both layouts are implementation details of the underlying language, language
implementation, language version, and the platform used.
It should be no surprise then, that for example an
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">int</span></tt> in C++ looks
nothing like a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PyIntObject</span></tt>, even
though it is perfectly possible, in both cases, to point out in memory where
the integer value is.
The two representations can thus not make use of the same block of memory
internally.
However, the requirement is that the access to C++ from Python looks and feels
natural in its use, not that the mapping is exact.
Another requirement is that we want access to the actual object from both
Python and C++.
In practice, it is easier to provide natural access to C++ from Python than
the other way around, because the choices of memory layout in C++ are far more
restrictive: the memory layout defines the access, as the actual class
definition is gone at run-time.
The best choice then, is that the Python object will act as a proxy to the C++
object, with the actual data always being in C++.

</p>
<p>From here it follows that if the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_i</span></tt> data member
lives in C++, then Python needs some kind of helper to access it.
Conveniently, since version 2.2, Python has a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">property</span></tt> construct
that can take a getter and setter function that are called when the property
is used in Python code, and present it to the programmer as if it were a data
member.
So we arrive at this (note how the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">property</span></tt> instance
is a variable at the class level):

</p>
<pre>    class A(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self._cppthis = construct_new_A()
        m_i = property(get_m_i, set_m_i)
        m_d = property(get_m_d, set_m_d)</pre>

<p>The
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">construct_new_A</span></tt>
helper is not very interesting (the reflection layer can provide for it
directly), and methods are a subject for part 2 of this posting, so focus on
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_m_i</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">set_m_i</span></tt>.
In order for the getter to work, the method needs to have access to the C++
instance for which the Python object is a proxy.
On access, Python will call the getter function with the proxy instance for
which it is called.
The proxy has a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_cppthis</span></tt> data
member from which the C++ instance can be accessed (think of it as a pointer)
and all is good, at least for
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_i</span></tt>.
The second data member
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_d</span></tt>, however,
requires some more work: it is located at some offset into
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_cppthis</span></tt>.
This offset can be obtained from the reflection information, which lets the
C++ compiler calculate it, so details such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_padding#Data_structure_padding">byte padding</a>
are fully accounted for.
Since the setter also needs the offset, and since both share some more details
such as the containing class and type information of the data member, it is
natural to create a custom property class.
The getter and setter methods then become bound methods of an instance of that
custom property,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CPPDataMember</span></tt>, and
there is one such instance per data member.
Think of something along these lines:

</p>
<pre>    def make_datamember(cppclass, name):
        cppdm = cppyy.CPPDataMember(cppclass, name)
        return property(cppdm.get, cppdm.set)</pre>

where the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make_datamember</span></tt>
function replaces the call to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">property</span></tt> in the
class definition above.

<p>Now hold on a minute!
Before it was argued that Python and C++ can not share the same underlying
memory structure, because of choices internal to the language.
But if on the Python side choices are being made by the developer of the
language bindings, that is no longer a limitation.
In other words, why not go through e.g. the Python extension API, and do
this:

</p>
<pre>    struct A_pyproxy {
        PyObject_HEAD
        int    m_i;
        double m_d;
    };</pre>

<p>Doing so would save on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc">malloc overhead</a> and remove
a pointer indirection.
There are some technical issues specific to PyPy for such a choice: there is
no such thing as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PyPyObject_HEAD</span></tt>
and the layout of objects is not a given as that is decided only at
translation time.
But assume that those issues can be solved, and also accept that there is no
problem in creating structure definitions like this at run-time, since the
reflection layer can provide both the required size and access to the
placement
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">new operator</span></tt>
(compare e.g. CPython's
<a href="https://docs.python.org/library/struct.html">struct module</a>).
There is then still a more fundamental problem: it must be possible to take
over ownership in Python from instances created in C++ and vice-versa.
With a proxy scheme, that is trivial: just pass the pointer and do the
necessary bookkeeping.
With an embedded object, however, not every use case can be implemented: e.g.
if an object is created in Python, passed to C++, and deleted in C++, it
must have been allocated independently.
The proxy approach is therefore still the best choice, although embedding
objects may provide for optimizations in some use cases.


</p>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<p>The next step, is to take a more complicated C++ class, one with inheritance
(I'm leaving out details such as constructors etc., for brevity):

</p>
<pre>    class A {
    public:
        virtual ~A() {}
        int    m_i;
        double m_d;
    };

    class B : public A {
    public:
        virtual ~B() {}
        int    m_j;
    };</pre>

<p>From the previous discussion, it should already be clear what this will look
like in Python:

</p>
<pre>    class A(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self._cppthis = construct_new_A()
        m_i = make_datamember('A', 'm_i')
        m_d = make_datamember('A', 'm_d')

    class B(A):
        def __init__(self):
            self._cppthis = construct_new_B()
        m_j = make_datamember('B', 'm_j')</pre>

<p>There are some minor adjustments needed, however.
For one, the offset of the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_i</span></tt> data member
may be no longer zero: it is possible that a virtual function dispatch table
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">vtable</a>)
pointer is added at the beginning of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> (an alternative
is to have the vtable pointer at the end of the object).
But if
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_i</span></tt> is handled the
same way as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_d</span></tt>, with the
offset provided by the compiler, then the compiler will add the bits, if any,
for the vtable pointer and all is still fine.
A real problem could come in however, with a call of the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_i</span></tt> property on
an instance of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt>: in that case,
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_cppthis</span></tt>
points to a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt>
instance, whereas the getter/setter pair expect an
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> instance.
In practice, this is usually not a problem: compilers will align
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> and calculate
an offset for
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_j</span></tt> from the start
of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>.
Still, that is an implementation detail (even though it is one that can be
determined at run-time and thus taken advantage of by the JIT), so it can not
be relied upon.
The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_i</span></tt> getter
thus needs to take into account that it can be called with a derived type,
and so it needs to add an additional offset.
With that modification, the code looks something like this (as you would have
guessed, this is getting more and more into pseudo-code territory, although it
is conceptually close to the actual implementation in cppyy):

</p>
<pre>    def get_m_i(self):
        return int(self._cppthis + offset(A, m_i) + offset(self.__class__, A))</pre>

<p>Which is a shame, really, because the offset between
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> is going
to be zero most of the time in practice, and the JIT can not completely
<a href="../posts/2011/03/controlling-tracing-of-interpreter-with_15-3281215865169782921.html">elide</a>
the offset calculation (as we will see later; it is easy enough to elide if
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self.__class__</span></tt> is
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>, though).
One possible solution is to repeat the properties for each derived class, i.e.
to have a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_B_m_i</span></tt> etc., but
that looks ugly on the Python side and anyway
does not work in all cases: e.g. with multiple inheritance where there are
data members with the same name in both bases, or if
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> itself has a
public data member called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m_i</span></tt> that shadows
the one from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>.
The optimization then, is achieved by making
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> in charge of the
offset calculations, by making
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">offset</span></tt> a method of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt>, like so:

</p>
<pre>    def get_m_i(self):
        return int(self._cppthis + offset(A, m_i) + self.offset(A))</pre>

<p>The insight is that by scanning the inheritance hierarchy of a derived
class like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt>, you
can know statically whether it may sometimes need offsets, or whether the
offsets are always going to be zero.
Hence, if the offsets are always zero, the method
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">offset</span></tt> on
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> will
simply return the literal
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></tt> as its
implementation, with the JIT taking care of the rest through inlining and
constant folding.
If the offset could be non-zero, then the method will perform an actual
calculation, and it will let the JIT elide the call only if possible.


</p>
<h3>Multiple Virtual Inheritance</h3>

<p>Next up would be multiple inheritance, but that is not very interesting: we
already have the offset calculation between the actual and base class, which
is all that is needed to resolve any multiple inheritance hierarchy.
So, skip that and move on to multiple <i>virtual</i> inheritance.
That that is going to be a tad more complicated will be clear if you show the
following code snippet to any old C++ hand and see how they respond.
Most likely you will be told: "Don't ever do that."
But if code can be written, it will be written, and so for the sake of the
argument, what would this look like in Python:

</p>
<pre>    class A {
    public:
        virtual ~A() {}
        int m_a;
    };

    class B : public virtual A {
    public:
        virtual ~B() {}
        int m_b;
    };

    class C : public virtual A {
    public:
        virtual ~C() {}
        int m_c;
    };

    class D : public virtual B, public virtual C {
    public:
        virtual ~D() {}
        int m_d;
    };</pre>

<p>Actually, nothing changes from what we have seen so far: the scheme as laid
out above is fully sufficient.
For example, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">D</span></tt>
would simply look like:

</p>
<pre>    class D(B, C):
        def __init__(self):
            self._cppthis = construct_new_D()
        m_d = make_datamember('D', 'm_d')</pre>

<p>Point being, the only complication added by the multiple virtual
inheritance, is that navigation of the C++ instance happens with pointers
internal to the instance rather than with offsets.
However, it is still a fixed offset from any location to any other location
within the instance as its parts are laid out consecutively in memory (this is
not a requirement, but it is the most efficient, so it is what is used in
practice).
But what you can not do, is determine the offset statically: you need a live
(i.e. constructed) object for any offset calculations.
In Python, everything is always done dynamically, so that is of itself not a
limitation.
Furthermore,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self</span></tt> is already
passed to the offset calculation (remember that this was done to put the
calculation in the derived class, to optimize the common case of zero
offset), thus a live C++ instance is there precisely when it is needed.
The call to the offset calculation is hard to elide, since the instance will
be passed to a C++ helper and so the most the JIT can do is guard on the
instance's memory address, which is likely to change between traces.
Instead, explicit caching is needed on the base and derived types, allowing
the JIT to elide the lookup in the explicit cache.


</p>
<h3>Static Data Members and Global Variables</h3>

<p>That, so far, covers all access to instance data members.
Next up are static data members and global variables.
A complication here is that a Python
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">property</span></tt> needs to
live on the class in order to work its magic.
Otherwise, if you get the property, it will simply return the getter function,
and if you set it, it will dissappear.
The logical conclusion then, is that a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">property</span></tt>
representing a static or global variable, needs to live on the class of the
class, or the metaclass.
If done directly though, that would mean that every static data member is
available from every class, since all Python classes have the same metaclass,
which is class
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type</span></tt> (and which is
its own metaclass).
To prevent that from happening and because
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type</span></tt> is actually
immutable, each proxy class needs to have its own custom metaclass.
Furthermore, since static data can also be accessed on the instance, the
class, too, gets a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">property</span></tt> object
for each static data member.
Expressed in code, for a basic C++ class, this looks as follows:

</p>
<pre>    class A {
    public:
        static int s_i;
    };</pre>

<p>Paired with some Python code such as this, needed to expose the static
variable both on the class and the instance level:

</p>
<pre>    meta_A = type(CppClassMeta, 'meta_A', [CPPMetaBase], {})
    meta_A.s_i = make_datamember('A', 's_i')

    class A(object):
        __metaclass__ = meta_A
        s_i = make_datamember('A', 's_i')</pre>

<p>Inheritance adds no complications for the access of static data per se, but
there is the issue that the metaclasses must follow the same hierarchy as the
proxy classes, for the Python method resolution order (MRO) to work.
In other words, there are two complete, parallel class hierarchies that map
one-to-one: a hierarchy for the proxy classes and one for their metaclasses.

</p>
<p>A parallel class hierarchy is used also in other highly dynamic,
object-oriented environments, such as for example
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaclass#In_Smalltalk-80">Smalltalk</a>.
In Smalltalk as well, class-level constructs, such as class methods and data
members, are defined for the class in the metaclass.
A metaclass hierarchy has further uses, such as lazy loading of nested
classes and member templates (this would be coded up in the base class of all
metaclasses:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CPPMetaBase</span></tt>), and
makes it possible to distribute these over different reflection libraries.
With this in place, you can write Python codes like so:

</p>
<pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from cppyy.gbl import A
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a = A()
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a.s_i = 42
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print A.s_i == a.s_i
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # etc.</pre>

<p>The implementation of the getter for
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">s_i</span></tt> is a lot
easier than for instance data: the static data lives at a fixed, global,
address, so no offset calculations are needed.
The same is done for global data or global data living in namespaces:
namespaces are represented as Python classes, and global data are implemented
as properties on them.
The need for a metaclass is one of the reasons why it is easier for namespaces
to be classes: module objects are too restrictive.
And even though namespaces are not modules, you still can, with
some limitations,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">import</span></tt> from
them anyway.

</p>
<p>It is common that global objects themselves are pointers, and therefore it
is allowed that the stored
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_cppthis</span></tt> is not a
pointer to a C++ object, but rather a pointer to a pointer to a C++ object.
A double pointer, as it were.
This way, if the C++ code updates the global pointer, it will automatically
reflect on the Python side in the proxy.
Likewise, if on the Python side the pointer gets set to a different variable,
it is the pointer that gets updated, and this will be visible on the C++ side.
In general, however, the same caveat as for normal Python code applies: in
order to set a global object, it needs to be set within the scope of that
global object.
As an example, consider the following code for a C++ namespace
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NS</span></tt> with
global variable
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">g_a</span></tt>, which behaves
the same as Python code for what concerns the visibility of changes to the
global variable:

</p>
<pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from cppyy.gbl import NS, A
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from NS import g_a
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; g_a = A(42)                     # does NOT update C++ side
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print NS.g_a.m_i
    13                                   # the old value happens to be 13
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NS.g_a = A(42)                  # does update C++ side
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print NS.g_a.m_i
    42
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # etc.</pre>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>That covers all there is to know about data member access of C++ classes in
Python through a reflection layer!
A few final notes: RPython does not support metaclasses, and so the
construction of proxy classes (code like
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make_datamember</span></tt>
above) happens in Python code instead.
There is an overhead penalty of about 2x over pure RPython code associated
with that, due to extra guards that get inserted by the JIT.
A factor of 2 sounds like a lot, but the overhead is tiny to begin with, and
2x of tiny is still tiny and it's not easy to measure.
The class definition of the custom property,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CPPDataMember</span></tt>, is
in RPython code, to be transparent to the JIT.
The actual offset calculations are in the reflection layer.
Having the proxy class creation in Python, with structural code in RPython,
complicates matters if proxy classes need to be constructed on-demand.
For example, if an instance of an as-of-yet unseen type is returned by a
method.
Explaining how that is solved is a topic of part 2, method calls, so stay
tuned.

</p>
<p>This posting laid out the reasoning behind the object representation of C++
objects in Python by cppyy for the purpose of data member access.
It explained how the chosen representation of offsets gives rise to a very
pythonic representation, which allows Python introspection tools to work as
expected.
It also explained some of the optimizations done for the benefit of the JIT.
Next up are method calls, which will be described in part 2.</p>

    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>This is a short "position paper" kind of post about my view (Armin
Rigo's) on the future of multicore programming in high-level languages.
It is a summary of the
keynote presentation at EuroPython.  As I learned by talking with people
afterwards, I am not a good enough speaker to manage to convey a deeper
message in a 20-minutes talk.  I will try instead to convey it in a
250-lines post...</p>
<p>This is about three points:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>We often hear about people wanting a version of Python running without
the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): a "GIL-less Python".  But what we
programmers really need is not just a GIL-less Python --- we need a
higher-level way to write multithreaded programs than using directly
threads and locks.  One way is Automatic Mutual Exclusion (AME), which
would give us an "AME Python".</li>
<li>A good enough Software Transactional Memory (STM) system can be used
as an internal tool to do that.
This is what we are building into an "AME PyPy".</li>
<li>The picture is darker for CPython, though there is a way too.  The
problem is that when we say STM, we think about either GCC 4.7's STM
support, or Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM).  However, both
solutions are enough for a "GIL-less CPython", but not
for "AME CPython", due to capacity limitations.  For the latter, we
need somehow to add some large-scale STM into the compiler.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me explain these points in more details.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a id="gil-less-versus-ame" name="gil-less-versus-ame">GIL-less versus AME</a></h3>
<p>The first point is in favor of the so-called Automatic Mutual Exclusion
approach.  The issue with using threads (in any language with or without
a GIL) is that threads are fundamentally non-deterministic.  In other
words, the programs' behaviors are not reproductible at all, and worse,
we cannot even reason about it --- it becomes quickly messy.  We would
have to consider all possible combinations of code paths and timings,
and we cannot hope to write tests that cover all combinations.  This
fact is often documented as one of the main blockers towards writing
successful multithreaded applications.</p>
<p>We need to solve this issue with a higher-level solution.  Such
solutions exist theoretically, and Automatic Mutual Exclusion (AME) is
one of them.  The idea of AME is that we divide the execution of each
thread into a number of "atomic blocks".  Each block is well-delimited
and typically large.  Each block runs atomically, as if it acquired a
GIL for its whole duration.  The trick is that internally we use
Transactional Memory, which is a technique that lets the system run the
atomic blocks from each thread in parallel, while giving the programmer
the illusion that the blocks have been run in some global serialized
order.</p>
<p>This doesn't magically solve all possible issues, but it helps a lot: it
is far easier to reason in terms of a random ordering of large atomic
blocks than in terms of a random ordering of lines of code --- not to
mention the mess that multithreaded C is, where even a random ordering
of instructions is not a sufficient model any more.</p>
<p>How do such atomic blocks look like?  For example, a program might
contain a loop over all keys of a dictionary, performing some
"mostly-independent" work on each value.  This is a typical example:
each atomic block is one iteration through the loop.  By using the
technique described here, we can run the iterations in parallel
(e.g. using a thread pool) but using AME to ensure that they appear to
run serially.</p>
<p>In Python, we don't care about the order in which the loop iterations
are done, because we are anyway iterating over the keys of a dictionary.
So we get exactly the same effect as before: the iterations still run in
some random order, but --- and that's the important point --- they
appear to run in a
global serialized order.  In other words, we introduced parallelism, but
only under the hood: from the programmer's point of view, his program
still appears to run completely serially.  Parallelisation as a
theoretically invisible optimization...  more about the "theoretically"
in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Note that randomness of order is not fundamental: they are techniques
building on top of AME that can be used to force the order of the
atomic blocks, if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a id="pypy-and-stm-ame" name="pypy-and-stm-ame">PyPy and STM/AME</a></h3>
<p>Talking more precisely about PyPy: the current prototype <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-stm</span></tt> is
doing precisely this.  In <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-stm</span></tt>, the length of the atomic blocks is
selected in one of two ways: either explicitly or automatically.</p>
<p>The automatic selection gives blocks corresponding to some small number
of bytecodes, in which case we have merely a GIL-less Python: multiple
threads will appear to run serially, with the execution randomly
switching from one thread to another at bytecode boundaries, just like
in CPython.</p>
<p>The explicit selection is closer to what was described in the previous
section: someone --- the programmer or the author of some library that
the programmer uses --- will explicitly put <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">thread.atomic:</span></tt> in
the source, which delimitates an atomic block.  For example, we can use
it to build a library that can be used to iterate over the keys of a
dictionary: instead of iterating over the dictionary directly, we would
use some custom utility which gives the elements "in parallel".  It
would give them by using internally a pool of threads, but enclosing
every handling of an element into such a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">thread.atomic</span></tt> block.</p>
<p>This gives the nice illusion of a global serialized order, and thus
gives us a well-behaving model of the program's behavior.</p>
<p>Restating this differently,
the <em>only</em> semantical difference between <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-stm</span></tt> and
a regular PyPy or CPython is that it has <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">thread.atomic</span></tt>, which is a
context manager that gives the illusion of forcing the GIL to not be
released during the execution of the corresponding block of code.  Apart
from this addition, they are apparently identical.</p>
<p>Of course they are only semantically identical if we ignore performance:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-stm</span></tt> uses multiple threads and can potentially benefit from that
on multicore machines.  The drawback is: when does it benefit, and how
much?  The answer to this question is not immediate.  The programmer
will usually have to detect and locate places that cause too many
"conflicts" in the Transactional Memory sense.  A conflict occurs when
two atomic blocks write to the same location, or when <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> reads it,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> writes it, but <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> finishes first and commits.  A conflict
causes the execution of one atomic block to be aborted and restarted,
due to another block committing.  Although the process is transparent,
if it occurs more than occasionally, then it has a negative impact on
performance.</p>
<p>There is no out-of-the-box perfect solution for solving all conflicts.
What we will need is more tools to detect them and deal with them, data
structures that are made aware of the risks of "internal" conflicts when
externally there shouldn't be one, and so on.  There is some work ahead.</p>
<p>The point here is that from the point of view of the final programmer,
we gets conflicts that we should resolve --- but at any point, our
program is <em>correct</em>, even if it may not be yet as efficient as it could
be.  This is the opposite of regular multithreading, where programs are
efficient but not as correct as they could be.  In other words, as we
all know, we only have resources to do the easy 80% of the work and not
the remaining hard 20%.  So in this model we get a program that has 80%
of the theoretical maximum of performance and it's fine.  In the regular
multithreading model we would instead only manage to remove 80% of the
bugs, and we are left with obscure rare crashes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a id="cpython-and-htm" name="cpython-and-htm">CPython and HTM</a></h3>
<p>Couldn't we do the same for CPython?  The problem here is that
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-stm</span></tt> is implemented as a transformation step during translation,
which is not directly possible in CPython.  Here are our options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We could review and change the C code everywhere in CPython.</li>
<li>We use GCC 4.7, which supports some form of STM.</li>
<li>We wait until Intel's next generation of CPUs comes out ("Haswell")
and use HTM.</li>
<li>We write our own C code transformation within a compiler (e.g. LLVM).</li>
</ul>
<p>I will personally file the first solution in the "thanks but no thanks"
category.  If anything, it will give us another fork of CPython that
will painfully struggle to keep not more than 3-4 versions behind, and
then eventually die.  It is very unlikely to be ever merged into the
CPython trunk, because it would need changes <em>everywhere</em>.  Not to
mention that these changes would be very experimental: tomorrow we might
figure out that different changes would have been better, and have to
start from scratch again.</p>
<p>Let us turn instead to the next two solutions.  Both of these solutions
are geared toward small-scale transactions, but not long-running ones.
For example, I have no clue how to give GCC rules about performing I/O
in a transaction --- this seems not supported at all; and moreover
looking at the STM library that is available so far to be linked with
the compiled program, it assumes short transactions only.  By contrast,
when I say "long transaction" I mean transactions that can run for 0.1
seconds or more.  To give you an idea, in 0.1 seconds a PyPy program
allocates and frees on the order of ~50MB of memory.</p>
<p>Intel's Hardware Transactional Memory solution is both more flexible and
comes with a stricter limit.  In one word, the transaction boundaries
are given by a pair of special CPU instructions that make the CPU enter
or leave "transactional" mode.  If the transaction aborts, the CPU
cancels any change, rolls back to the "enter" instruction and causes
this instruction to return an error code instead of re-entering
transactional mode (a bit like a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fork()</span></tt>).  The software then detects
the error code.  Typically, if transactions are rarely cancelled, it is
fine to fall back to a GIL-like solution just to redo these cancelled
transactions.</p>
<p>About the implementation: this is done by recording all the changes that
a transaction wants to do to the main memory, and keeping them invisible
to other CPUs.  This is "easily" achieved by keeping them inside this
CPU's local cache; rolling back is then just a matter of discarding a
part of this cache without committing it to memory.  From this point of
view, <a class="reference" href="https://arstechnica.com/business/2012/02/transactional-memory-going-mainstream-with-intel-haswell/">there is a lot to bet</a> that we are actually talking about the
regular per-core Level 1 and Level 2 caches --- so any transaction that
cannot fully store its read and written data in the 64+256KB of the L1+L2
caches will abort.</p>
<p>So what does it mean?  A Python interpreter overflows the L1 cache of
the CPU very quickly: just creating new Python function frames takes a
lot of memory (on the order of magnitude of 1/100 of the whole L1
cache).  Adding a 256KB L2 cache into the picture helps, particularly
because it is highly associative and thus avoids a lot of fake conflicts.
However, as long as the HTM support is limited to L1+L2 caches,
it is not going to be enough to run an "AME Python" with any sort of
medium-to-long transaction.  It can
run a "GIL-less Python", though: just running a few hundred or even
thousand bytecodes at a time should fit in the L1+L2 caches, for most
bytecodes.</p>
<p>I would vaguely guess that it will take on the order of 10 years until
CPU cache sizes grow enough for a CPU in HTM mode to actually be able to
run 0.1-second transactions.  (Of course in 10 years' time a lot of other
things may occur too, including the whole Transactional Memory model
being displaced by something else.)</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><a id="write-your-own-stm-for-c" name="write-your-own-stm-for-c">Write your own STM for C</a></h3>
<p>Let's discuss now the last option: if neither GCC 4.7 nor HTM are
sufficient for an "AME CPython", then we might want to
write our own C compiler patch (as either extra work on GCC 4.7, or an
extra pass to LLVM, for example).</p>
<p>We would have to deal with the fact that we get low-level information,
and somehow need to preserve interesting high-level bits through the
compiler up to the point at which our pass runs: for example, whether
the field we read is immutable or not.  (This is important because some
common objects are immutable, e.g. PyIntObject.  Immutable reads don't
need to be recorded, whereas reads of mutable data must be protected
against other threads modifying them.)  We can also have custom code to
handle the reference counters: e.g. not consider it a conflict if
multiple transactions have changed the same reference counter, but just
resolve it automatically at commit time.  We are also free to handle I/O
in the way we want.</p>
<p>More generally, the advantage of this approach over both the current GCC
4.7 and over HTM is that we control the whole process.  While this still
looks like a lot of work, it looks doable.  It would be possible to come
up with a minimal patch of CPython that can be accepted into core
without too much troubles (e.g. to mark immutable fields and tweak the
refcounting macros), and keep all the cleverness inside the compiler
extension.</p>

<h3><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>I would assume that a programming model specific to PyPy and not
applicable to CPython has little chances to catch on, as long as PyPy is
not the main Python interpreter (which looks unlikely to change anytime
soon).  Thus as long as only PyPy has AME, it looks like it will not
become the main model of multicore usage in Python.  However, I can
conclude with a more positive note than during the EuroPython
conference: it is a lot of work, but there is a more-or-less reasonable
way forward to have an AME version of CPython too.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-stm</span></tt> is around the corner, and together with
tools developed on top of it, it might become really useful and used.  I
hope that in the next few years this work will trigger enough motivation
for CPython to follow the ideas.</p>

          <p>A question: does a “donate towards STM/AME in pypy” also count as a donation towards the CPython work? Getting the hooks in CPython to allow exploration and implementation of this seems at least as important as the pypy work. In fact, I think it’s quite a bit more important.</p>

          <p>With HTM you don't have to have a one-to-one mapping between your application transactions and the hardware interface. You can also have an STM, that is implemented using HTM. So you may do all the book-keeping yourself in software, but then at commit time use HTM.</p>

          <p>Jesus Christ why don't we all just spend 5 min fiddling with the multiprocessing module and learn how to partition execution and queues like we partition sequences of statements into functions?  So sick of GIL articles and the obsession with not learning how to divide up the work and communicate.  In some ways the need to recognize narrow channels where relatively small amounts of data are being channeled through relatively intense blocks of execution and create readable, explicit structure around those blocks might actually improve the comprehensibility of some code I've seen.

If anything bugs in a magical system are harder to find than understanding explicit structure and explicit structure that's elegant is neither crufty nor slow.  Eventually, no interpreter will save a bad programmer.  Are we next going to enable the novice "Pythonista" to forego any knowledge of algorithms?  <br><br>We -need- JIT on production systems to get response times down for template processing without micro-caching out the wazoo.  These types of services are already parallel by nature of the servers and usually I/O bound except for the few slow parts.  Cython already serves such an excellent roll for both C/C++ API's AND speed AND optimizing existing python code with minimal changes.  JIT PyPy playing well with Cython would make Python very generally uber.  Users who actually get multiprocessing and can divide up the workflow won't want a slower implementation of any other kind.  Getting a somewhat good solution for 'free' is not nearly as appealing as the additional headroom afforded by an incremental user cost (adding some strong typing or patching a function to work with pypy/py3k).</p>

Some classes of problems have other solutions that work well so far and I'm not proposing to change them.  Big servers can naturally handle big loads just by having enough processes.  What I'm describing instead is a pure language feature that may or may not help in particular cases --- and there are other cases than the one you describe where the situation is very different and multiprocessing doesn't help at all.  Also, you have to realise that any argument "we will never need feature X because we can work around it using hack Y" is bound to lose eventually: at least some people in some cases will need the clean feature X because the hack Y is too complicated to learn or use correctly.<br><br>@Benjamin: "atomic" actually means "not decomposable", not necessarily "as small as possible".  This focus on smallness of transaction IMO is an artefact of last decade's research focus.  In my posts I tend to focus on large transaction as a counterpoint: in the use cases I have in mind there is no guarantee that all transactions will be small.  Some of them may be, but others not, and this is a restriction.  In things like "one iteration through this loop = one transaction", some of these iterations go away and do a lot of stuff.</p>

          <p>Transactional programming is neat.  So are Goroutines and functional-style parallelism.  On the other hand, I think that C and C++ (or at least C1x and C++11) get one thing completely right: they don't try to enforce any particular threading model.  For some problems (like reference counts, as you mention), you really do want a different model.  As long as other languages force me to choose a single model, my big projects will stay in C/C++.</p>

          <p>@Benjamin: a user program might be optimized to reduce its memory usage, for example by carefully reusing objects instead of throwing them away, finding more memory-efficient constructs, and so on.  But in many cases in Python you don't care too much.  Similarly, I expect that it's possible to reduce the size of transactions by splitting them up carefully, hoping to get some extras in performance.  But most importantly I'd like a system where the programmer didn't have to care overmuch about that.  It should still work reasonably well for *any* size, just like a reasonable GC should work for any heap size.<br><br>If I had to describe the main issue I have against HTM, it is that beyond some transaction size we loose all parallelism because it has to fall back on the GIL.<br><br>Well, now that I think about it, it's the same in memory usage: if you grow past the RAM size, the program is suddenly swapping, and performance becomes terrible.

          <p>@Mark D.: I don't know if "a dozen memory modification" comes from real work in the field or is just a guess.  My own guess would be that Intel Haswell supports easily hunderds of modifications, possibly thousands.  Moreover the built-in cache coherency mechanisms should be used here too, in a way that scales with the cache size; this means they should not be "prohibitively expensive".<br>Of course I know that in 0.1 seconds we do far more than thousands writes, but I think that nothing strictly limits the progression of future processors in that respect.<br><br>The occurrence of conflicts in large transactions depends on two factors.  First, "true conflicts", which is the hard problem, but which I think should be relatively deterministic and debuggable with new tools.  Second, "false conflicts", which is the HTM/STM mechanism detecting a conflict when there is none.  To handle large transactions this should occur with a probability very, very close to 0% for each memory access.  In pypy-stm it is 0%, but indeed, with HTM it depends on how close to 0% they can get.  I have no data on that.</p>

<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>Not much has happened in the past few months with numpypy development. A part
of the reason was <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2012/07/hello-everyone-6869934374873967346.html">doing other stuff</a> for me, a part of the reason was
various unexpected visa-related admin, a part of the reason was EuroPython
and a part was long-awaited holiday.</p>
<p>The thing that's maybe worth mentioning is that it does not mean the donations
disappeared in the mist. PyPy developers are being paid to work on NumPyPy on
an hourly basis - that means if I decide to take holidays or work on something
else, the money is simply staying in the account until later.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all the donations, I hope to get back to this topic soon!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
fijal</p>

    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>We released <a class="reference" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org">CFFI 0.2.1</a> (expected to be 1.0 soon).  CFFI is a way to call C from Python.</p>
<p><b>EDIT:</b> Win32 was broken in 0.2.  Fixed.</p>
<p>This release is only for CPython 2.6 or 2.7.  PyPy support is coming in<br>
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ffi-backend</span></tt> branch, but not finished yet.  CPython 3.x would be<br>
easy but requires the help of someone.</p>
<p>The package is available <a class="reference" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/cffi/cffi">on bitbucket</a> as well as <a class="reference" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org">documented</a>. You<br>
can also install it straight from the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cffi">python package index</a>: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip install cffi</span></tt></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Contains numerous small changes and support for more C-isms.</li>
<li>The biggest news is the support for <a class="reference" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html#distributing-modules-using-cffi">installing packages</a> that use<br><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ffi.verify()</span></tt> on machines without a C compiler.  Arguably, this<br>
lifts the last serious restriction for people to use CFFI.</li>
<li>Partial list of smaller changes:<ul>
<li>mappings between 'wchar_t' and Python unicodes</li>
<li>the introduction of ffi.NULL</li>
<li>a possibly clearer API for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ffi.new()</span></tt>: e.g. to allocate a single <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">int</span></tt> and obtain a pointer to it, use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ffi.new("int *")</span></tt> instead of the old<br><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ffi.new("int")</span></tt>
</li>
<li>and of course a plethora of smaller bug fixes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CFFI uses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pkg-config</span></tt> to install itself if available.  This helps<br>
locate <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libffi</span></tt> on modern Linuxes.  Mac OS/X support is available too<br>
(see the detailed <a class="reference" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html#macos-10-6">installation instructions</a>).  Win32 should work out<br>
of the box.  Win64 has not been really tested yet.</li>

    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I'm proud to release the result of a Facebook-sponsored study on the feasibility of
using the RPython toolchain to produce a PHP interpreter. The rules were
simple: two months; one person; get as close to PHP as possible, implementing
enough warts and corner cases to be reasonably sure that it answers hard
problems in the PHP language. The outcome is called <tt class="docutils literal">Hippy VM</tt> and implements
most of the PHP 1.0 language (functions, arrays, ints, floats and strings).
This should be considered an alpha release.</p>
<p>The resulting interpreter is obviously incomplete – it does not support all
modern PHP constructs (classes are completely unimplemented), builtin functions,
grammar productions, web server integration, builtin libraries
etc., etc.. It's <strong>just</strong> complete enough for me to reasonably be able to
say that – given some engineering effort – it's possible to provide a rock-solid
and fast PHP VM using PyPy technologies.</p>
<p>The result is available in a <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/fijal/hippyvm">Bitbucket repo</a> and is released under the MIT
license.</p>
<div class="section" id="performance">
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The table below shows a few benchmarks comparing Hippy VM to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zend.com">Zend</a> (a standard
PHP interpreter available in Linux distributions) and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php">HipHop VM</a> (a PHP-to-C++
optimizing compiler developed by Facebook).  The versions used were Zend 5.3.2
(Zend Engine v2.3.0) and HipHop VM heads/vm-0-ga4fbb08028493df0f5e44f2bf7c042e859e245ab
(note that you need to check out the <tt class="docutils literal">vm</tt> branch to get the newest version).</p>
<p>The run was performed on 64-bit Linux running on a Xeon W3580 with 8M of
L2 cache, which was otherwise unoccupied.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to run it on the JITted version of HHVM, the new effort by Facebook,
but people involved with the project told me it's usually slower or comparable with the compiled HipHop.
Their JITted VM is still alpha software, so I'll update it as soon as I have the info.</p>

<p>The PyPy compiler toolchain provides a way to implement a dynamic
language interpreter in a high-level language called RPython. This is
a language which is lower-level than Python, but still higher-level than
C or C++: for example, RPython is a garbage-collected language. The killer
feature is that the toolchain will generate a JIT for your interpreter which
will be able to leverage most of the work that has been done on speeding up Python
in the PyPy project.  The resulting JIT is generated for your interpreter, and is not Python-specific.
This was one of the toolchain's original design decisions – in contrast to e.g. the JVM,
which was initially only used to interpret Java and later adjusted to serve as a platform for
dynamic languages.</p>
<p>Another important difference is that there is no common bytecode to which you compile both your
language and Python, so you don't inherit problems presented when implementing language X on top of,
say, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.parrot.org/">Parrot VM</a> or the JVM.  The PyPy toolchain does not impose constraints on the semantics of
your language, whereas the benefits of the JVM only apply to languages that map well onto Java concepts.</p>

<div class="section" id="php-deviations">
<h3>PHP deviations</h3>
<p>The project's biggest deviation from the PHP specification is probably
that GC is no longer reference counting. That means that the object finalizer, when
implemented, will not be called directly at the moment of object death, but
at some later point. There are possible future developments to alleviate that
problem, by providing "refcounted" objects when leaving the current scope.
Research has to be done in order to achieve that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assessment">
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>The RPython toolchain seems to be a cost-effective choice for writing
dynamic language VMs.  It both provides a fast JIT and gives you
access to low-level primitives when you need them. A good example is
in the directory <tt class="docutils literal">hippy/rpython</tt> which contains the implementation
of an ordered dictionary. An ordered dictionary is not a primitive
that RPython provides – it's not necessary for the goal of
implementing Python.  Now, implementing it on top of a normal dictionary
is possible, but inefficient. RPython provides a way to work
directly at a lower level, if you desire to do so.</p>
<p>Things that require improvements in RPython:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lack of mutable strings on the RPython level ended up being a problem.
I ended up using lists of characters; which are efficient, but inconvenient,
since they don't support any string methods.</li>
<li>Frame handling is too conservative and too Python-specific, especially around
the calls. It's possible to implement less general, but simpler and faster
frame handling implementation in RPython.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="status-of-the-implementation">
<h3>Status of the implementation</h3>
<p>Don't use it! It's a research prototype intended to assess the feasibility
of using RPython to create dynamic language VMs. The most notable
feature that's missing is reasonable error reporting. That said, I'm
confident it implements enough of the PHP language to prove that the full
implementation will present the same performance characteristics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benchmarks">
<h3>Benchmarks</h3>
<p>The benchmarks are a selection of computer language shootout benchmarks, as well
as <tt class="docutils literal">cache_get_scb</tt>, which is a part of old Facebook code. All benchmarks other
than this one (which is not open source, but definitely the most interesting :( ) are
available in the <tt class="docutils literal">bench</tt> directory. The Python program to run them is called
<tt class="docutils literal">runner.py</tt> and is in the same directory. It runs them 10 times, cutting off the first
3 runs (to ignore the JIT warm-up time) and averaging the rest. As you can see
the standard deviation is fairly minimal for all interpreters and runs; if
it's omitted it means it's below 0.5%.</p>
<p>The benchmarks were not selected for their ease of optimization – the optimizations
in the interpreter were written specifically for this set of benchmarks. No special JIT
optimizations were added, and barring what's mentioned below a vanilla PyPy 1.9 checkout
was used for compilation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="so-how-fast-will-my-website-run-if-this-is-completed">
<h3>So, how fast will my website run if this is completed?</h3>
<p>The truth is that I lack the benchmarks to be able to answer that right now. The core
of the PHP language is implemented up to the point where I'm confident
that the performance will not change as we get more of the PHP going.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-run-it">
<h3>How do I run it?</h3>
<p>Get a <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy">PyPy checkout</a>, apply the <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/2923845">diff</a> if you want to squeeze out the last
bits of performance and run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-checkout/pypy/bin/rpython</span> targethippy.py</tt> to
get an executable that resembles a PHP interpreter. You can also directly run
<tt class="docutils literal">python targethippy.py file.php</tt>, but this will be about 2000x slower.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rpython-modifications">
<h3>RPython modifications</h3>
<p>There was a modification that I did to the PyPy source code; the <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/2923845">diff</a>
is available. It's trivial, and should simply be made optional in the
RPython JIT generator, but it was easier just to do it, given the very constrained time
frame.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">gen_store_back_in_virtualizable</tt> was disabled. This feature is
necessary for Python frames but not for PHP frames. PHP frames
do not have to be kept alive after we exit a function.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future">
<h3>Future</h3>
<p>Hippy is a cool prototype that presents a very interesting path towards a fast
PHP VM.  However, at the moment I have too many other open source commitments
to take on the task of completing it in my spare time.  I do think that this project
has a lot of potential, but I will not commit to any further development at
this time.  If you send pull requests I'll try to review them.  I'm also open
to having further development on this project funded, so if you're interested
in this project and the potential of a fast PHP interpreter, please get in
touch.</p>

    <p>This is the fifth status update about our work on the <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/py3k">py3k branch</a>, which we<br>
can work on thanks to all of the people who <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2012/01/py3k-and-numpy-first-stage-thanks-to-3008917396290059758.html">donated</a> to the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/py3donate.html">py3k proposal</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from the usual "fix shallow py3k-related bugs" part, most of my work in<br>
this iteration has been to fix the bootstrap logic of the interpreter, in<br>
particular to setup the initial <tt class="docutils literal">sys.path</tt>.</p>
<p>Until few weeks ago, the logic to determine <tt class="docutils literal">sys.path</tt> was written entirely<br>
at app-level in <tt class="docutils literal">pypy/translator/goal/app_main.py</tt>, which is automatically<br>
included inside the executable during translation.  The algorithm is more or<br>
less like this:</p>
<blockquote><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>find the absolute path of the executable by looking at <tt class="docutils literal">sys.argv[0]</tt><br>
and cycling through all the directories in <tt class="docutils literal">PATH</tt>
</li>
<li>starting from there, go up in the directory hierarchy until we find a<br>
directory which contains <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib-python</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">lib_pypy</tt>
</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>This works fine for Python 2 where the paths and filenames are represented as<br>
8-bit strings, but it is a problem for Python 3 where we want to use unicode<br>
instead.  In particular, whenever we try to encode a 8-bit string into an<br>
unicode, PyPy asks the <tt class="docutils literal">_codecs</tt> built-in module to find the suitable<br>
codec. Then, <tt class="docutils literal">_codecs</tt> tries to import the <tt class="docutils literal">encodings</tt> package, to list<br>
all the available encodings. <tt class="docutils literal">encodings</tt> is a package of the standard<br>
library written in pure Python, so it is located inside<br><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib-python/3.2</span></tt>. But at this point in time we yet have to add<br><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib-python/3.2</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">sys.path</tt>, so the import fails.  Bootstrap problem!</p>
<p>The hard part was to find the problem: since it is an error which happens so<br>
early, the interpreter is not even able to display a traceback, because it<br>
cannot yet import <tt class="docutils literal">traceback.py</tt>. The only way to debug it was through some<br>
carefully placed <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> statement and the help of <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt>. Once found the<br>
problem, the solution was as easy as moving part of the logic to RPython,<br>
where we don't have bootstrap problems.</p>
<p>Once the problem was fixed, I was able to finally run all the CPython test<br>
against the compiled PyPy.  As expected there are lots of failures, and fixing<br>
them will be the topic of my next months.</p>

          <p>I solved a similar issue in Python 3.2. Python 3 did use the wrong encoding to encode/decode filenames. When I tried to use the filesystem encoding instead, I had an ugly bootstrap issue with encodings implemented in Python (whereas ASCII, latin1 and utf-8 are implemented in C with a fast-path).<br><br>The solution is to use C function to encode to/decode from the locale encoding, because the filesystem encoding is the locale encoding. mbstowcs() and wcstombs() are used until the Python codec machinery is ready.</p>

    <p>The cppyy module makes it possible to call into C++ from PyPy through the
<a class="reference external" href="https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/reflex">Reflex package</a>.
Work started about <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2010/07/cern-sprint-report-wrapping-c-libraries-6547377950791793143.html">two years ago</a>, with a <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2011/08/wrapping-c-libraries-with-reflection-3916959558080483711.html">follow-up sprint</a> a year later.
The module has now reached an acceptable level of maturity and initial
documentation with setup instructions, as well as a list of the currently
supported language features, are now <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cppyy.html">available here</a>.
There is a sizable (non-PyPy) set of unit and application tests that is still
being worked through, not all of them of general applicability, so development
continues its current somewhat random walk towards full language coverage.
However, if you find that cppyy by and large works for you except for certain
specific features, feel free to ask for them to be given higher priority.</p>
<p>Cppyy handles bindings differently than what is typically found in other
tools with a similar objective, so this update walks through some of these
differences, and explains why choices were made as they are.</p>
<p>The most visible difference, is from the viewpoint of the Python programmer
interacting with the module.
The two canonical ways of making Python part of a larger environment, are to
either embed or extend it.
The latter is done with so-called <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/release/2.7.3/extending/extending.html">extension modules</a>, which are explicitly
constructed to be very similar in their presentation to the Python programmer
as normal Python modules.
In cppyy, however, the external C++ world is presented from a single entrance
point, the global C++ namespace (in the form of the variable <tt class="docutils literal">cppyy.gbl</tt>).
Thus, instead of importing a package that contains your C++ classes, usage
looks like this (assuming class <tt class="docutils literal">MyClass</tt> in the global namespace):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import cppyy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; m = cppyy.gbl.MyClass()
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # etc.
</pre>
<p>This is more natural than it appears at first: C++ classes and functions are,
once compiled, represented by unique linker symbols, so it makes sense to give
them their own unique place on the Python side as well.
This organization allows pythonizations of C++ classes to propagate from one
code to another, ensures that all normal Python introspection (such as
<tt class="docutils literal">issubclass</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">isinstance</tt>) works as expected in all cases, and that it
is possible to represent C++ constructs such as typedefs simply by Python
references.
Achieving this unified presentation would clearly require a lot of internal
administration to track all C++ entities if they each lived in their own,
pre-built extension modules.
So instead, cppyy generates the C++ bindings at run-time, which brings us to
the next difference.</p>
<p>Then again, that is not really a difference: when writing or generating a
Python extension module, the result is some C code that consists of calls into
Python, which then gets compiled.
However, it is not the bindings themselves that are compiled; it is the code
that creates the bindings that gets compiled.
In other words, any generated or hand-written extension module does exactly
what cppyy does, except that they are much more specific in that the bound
code is hard-wired with e.g. fixed strings and external function calls.
The upshot is that in Python, where all objects are first-class and run-time
constructs, there is no difference whatsoever between bindings generated at
run-time, and bindings generated at ... well, run-time really.
There is a difference in organization, though, which goes back to the first
point of structuring the C++ class proxies in Python: given that a class will
settle in a unique place once bound, instead of inside a module that has no
meaning in the C++ world, it follows that it can also be uniquely located in
the first place.
In other words, cppyy can, and does, make use of a <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cppyy.html#automatic-class-loader">class loader</a> to
auto-load classes on-demand.</p>
<p>If at this point, this all reminds you of a bit ctypes, just with some extra
bells and whistles, you would be quite right.
In fact, internally cppyy makes heavy use of the RPython modules that form the
guts of ctypes.
The difficult part of ctypes, however, is the requirement to annotate
functions and structures.
That is not very pleasant in C, but in C++ there is a whole other level of
complexity in that the C++ standard specifies many low-level details, that are
required for dispatching calls and understanding object layout, as
"implementation defined."
Of course, in the case of Open Source compilers, getting at those details is
doable, but having to reverse engineer closed-source compilers gets old rather
quickly in more ways than one.
More generally, these implementation defined details prevent a clean interface,
i.e. without a further dependency on the compiler, into C++ like the one that
the <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2012/06/release-01-of-cffi-4760622823232463868.html">CFFI module</a> provides for C.
Still, once internal pointers have been followed, offsets have been calculated,
<tt class="docutils literal">this</tt> objects have been provided, etc., etc., the final dispatch into binary
C++ is no different than that into C, and cppyy will therefore be able to make
use of CFFI internally, like it does with ctypes today.
This is especially relevant in the <a class="reference external" href="https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cling">CLang/LLVM</a> world, where stub functions
are done away with.
To get the required low-level details then, cppyy relies on a back-end, rather
than getting it from the programmer, and this is where Reflex (together with
the relevant C++ compiler) comes in, largely automating this tedious process.</p>
<p>There is nothing special about Reflex per se, other than that it is relatively
lightweight, available, and has proven to be able to handle huge code bases.
It was a known quantity when work on cppyy started, and given the number
of moving parts in learning PyPy, that was a welcome relief.
Reflex is based on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gccxml.org">gccxml</a>, and can therefore handle pretty much any C or
C++ code that you care to throw at it.
It is also technically speaking obsolete as it will not support C++11, since
gccxml won't, but its expected replacement, based on CLang/LLVM, is not
quite there yet (we are looking at Q3 of this year).
In cppyy, access to Reflex, or any back-end for that matter, is through a
thin C API (see the schematic below): cppyy asks high level questions to the
back-end, and receives low-level results, some of which are in the form of
opaque handles.
This ensures that cppyy is not tied to any specific back-end.
In fact, currently it already supports another, <a class="reference external" href="https://root.cern.ch/root/Cint.html">CINT</a>, but that back-end is
of little interest outside of High Energy Physics (HEP).
The Python side is always the same, however, so any Python code based on cppyy
does not have to change if the back-end changes.
To use the system,  a back-end specific tool (<tt class="docutils literal">genreflex</tt> for Reflex) is
first run on a set of header files with a <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cppyy.html#advanced-example">selection file</a> for choosing the
required classes.
This produces a C++ file that must be compiled into a shared library, and a
corresponding map file for the class loader.
These shared libraries, with their map files alongside, can be put anywhere
as long as they can be located through the standard paths for the dynamic
loader.
With that in place, the setup is ready, and the C++ classes are available to
be used from cppyy.</p>

<p>So far, nothing that has been described is specific to PyPy.
In fact, most of the technologies described have been used for a long time
on CPython already, so why the need for a new, PyPy-specific, module?
To get to that, it is important to first understand how a call is mediated
between Python and C++.
In Python, there is the concept of a PyObject, which has a reference count, a
pointer to a type object, and some payload.
There are APIs to extract the low-level information from the payload for use
in the C++ call, and to repackage any results from the call.
This marshalling is where the bulk of the time is spent when dispatching.
To be absolutely precise, most C++ extension module generators produce slow
dispatches because they don't handle overloads efficiently, but even in there,
they still spend most of their time in the marshalling code, albeit in calls
that fail before trying the next overload.
In PyPy, speed is gained by having the JIT unbox objects into the payload only,
allowing it to become part of compiled traces.
If the same marshalling APIs were used, the JIT is forced to rebox the payload,
hand it over through the API, only to have it unboxed again by the binding.
Doing so is dreadfully inefficient.
The objective of cppyy, then, is to keep all code transparent to the JIT until
the absolute last possible moment, i.e. the call into C++ itself, therefore
allowing it to (more or less) directly pass the payload it already has, with
an absolute minimal amount of extra work.
In the extreme case when the binding is not to a call, but to a data member of
an object (or to a global variable), the memory address is delivered to the
JIT and this results in direct access with no overhead.
Note the interplay: cppyy in PyPy does not work like a binding in the CPython
sense that is a back-and-forth between the interpreter and the extension.
Instead, it does its work by being transparent to the JIT, allowing the JIT to
dissolve the binding.
And with that, we have made a full circle: if to work well with the JIT, and
in so doing achieve the best performance, you can not have marshalling or do
any other API-based driving, then the concept of compiled extension modules is
out, and the better solution is in run-time generated bindings.</p>
<p>That leaves one final point.
What if you do want to present an extension module-like interface to
programmers that use your code?
But of course, this is Python: everything consists of first-class objects,
whose behavior can be changed on the fly.
In CPython, you might hesitate to make such changes, as every overlay or
indirection results in quite a bit of overhead.
With PyPy, however, these layers are all optimized out of existences, making
that a non-issue.</p>
<p>This posting laid out the reasoning behind the organization of cppyy.
A follow-up is planned, to explain how C++ objects are handled and
represented internally.</p>

In the former case, no-one would drag in the dependency on a C++ compiler, just to use Reflex. Using e.g. CFFI is  a much better option. In the other case, there is no problem either way.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Wim</p>

          <p>From my past experience wrapping a C++ library to python is a whole lot more than just being able to call functions and having objects. <br><br>For example using a binding generator like SWIG you need to annotate your source, because the source alone does not have sufficient information to generate proper bindings (at least no bindings that feel python-like).<br><br>So I am wondering how Cppyy behaves in this area. <br><br>E.g. how does this play with templates?

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>We're pleased to announce the first public release, 0.1 of CFFI, a way to call C from Python.<br>
(This release does not support PyPy yet --- but we announce it here as it is planned for the<br>
next release :-)</p>
<p>The package is available <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/cffi/cffi">on bitbucket</a> as well as <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org">documented</a>. You can also install it<br>
straight from the python package index (pip).</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python.<br>
The interface is based on <a class="reference external" href="https://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html">LuaJIT's FFI</a> and follows a few principles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The goal is to call C code from Python.  You should be able to do so<br>
without learning a 3rd language: every alternative requires you to learn<br>
their own language (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.cython.org">Cython</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>) or API (<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a>).  So we tried to<br>
assume that you know Python and C and minimize the extra bits of API that<br>
you need to learn.</li>
<li>Keep all the Python-related logic in Python so that you don't need to<br>
write much C code (unlike <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/extending/extending.html">CPython native C extensions</a>).</li>
<li>Work either at the level of the ABI (Application Binary Interface)<br>
or the API (Application Programming Interface).  Usually, C<br>
libraries have a specified C API but often not an ABI (e.g. they may<br>
document a "struct" as having at least these fields, but maybe more).<br>
(<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> works at the ABI level, whereas Cython or <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/extending/extending.html">native C extensions</a><br>
work at the API level.)</li>
<li>We try to be complete.  For now some C99 constructs are not supported,<br>
but all C89 should be, including macros (and including macro "abuses",<br>
which you can manually wrap in saner-looking C functions).</li>
<li>We attempt to support both PyPy and CPython (although PyPy support is not<br>
complete yet) with a reasonable path for other Python implementations like<br>
IronPython and Jython.</li>
<li>Note that this project is <strong>not</strong> about embedding executable C code in<br>
Python, unlike <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scipy.org/Weave">Weave</a>.  This is about calling existing C libraries<br>
from Python.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="status-of-the-project">
<h3>Status of the project</h3>
<p>Consider this as a beta release. Creating CPython extensions is fully supported and the API should<br>
be relatively stable; however, minor adjustements of the API are possible.</p>
<p>PyPy support is not yet done and this is a goal for the next release. There are vague plans to make this the<br>
preferred way to call C from Python that can reliably work between PyPy and CPython.</p>
<p>Right now CFFI's verify() requires a C compiler and header files to be available at run-time.<br>
This limitation will be lifted in the near future and it'll contain a way to cache the resulting binary.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br><br>
Armin Rigo and Maciej Fijałkowski</p>
