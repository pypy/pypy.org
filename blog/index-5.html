    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>We can now compile a pypy-c that includes both thread support
and one of our semi-advanced garbage collectors.  This means
that threaded Python programs can now run not only with a
better performance, but without the annoyances of the Boehm
garbage collector.  (For example, Boehm doesn't like too much
seeing large numbers of __del__(), and our implementation of
ctypes uses them everywhere.)</p>

<p>Magic translation command (example):</p>

<p></p>
<pre>   translate.py --thread --gc=hybrid targetpypystandalone --faassen --allworkingmodules</pre>

<p>Note that multithreading in PyPy is based on a global
interpreter lock, as in CPython.  I imagine that we will get
rid of the global interpreter lock at some point in the future
-- I can certainly see how this might be done in PyPy, unlike
in CPython -- but it will be a lot of work nevertheless.  Given
our current priorities, it will probably not occur soon unless
someone steps in.</p>

          <p>By using fine-grained locking: locking every dictionary and list while it is used.  This is what Jython does (or more precisely, what Jython asks the JVM to do for it).  This certainly comes with a performance penalty, so it would only pay off if you actually have and can use multiple CPUs -- which is fine in PyPy: you would just translate different pypy-c's depending on the use case.<br><br>This would be a pain to implement in CPython, in particular because of refcounting.  Even if the Py_INCREF and Py_DECREF macros were made thread-safe, all C-level APIs that manipulate borrowed references might have to be redesigned.</p>

          <p>In response to maciej, OSes that implement copy-on-write fork (Linux, but not Windows, unsure about Mac OS X), don't take n times more memory.  Fine-grained locking and an OpenMP-like syntax would be potentially useful.  Maybe you could get a student to prototype these for you.  But I'm sure someone will find a way to parallelize Python eventually, or we'll all switch to some other language, as the number of cores goes to infinity.</p>

          <p>In my previous comment, I was partly wrong: COW reduces memory usage, however, in CPython the refcounting will cause the interpreter to write to every area of memory, so the reduction may not be that significant.  Also, IronPython supports fine-grained locks.</p>

    <p>In the last months, I've actively worked on the CLI backend for PyPy's
JIT generator, whose goal is to automatically generate JIT compilers
that produces .NET bytecode on the fly.</p>
<p>The CLI JIT backend is far from be completed and there is still a lot
of work to be done before it can handle the full PyPy's Python
interpreter; nevertheless, yesterday I finally got the first .NET
executable that contains a JIT for a very simple toy language called
<a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist/pypy/jit/tl/tlr.py">tlr</a>, which implements an interpreter for a minimal register based
virtual machine with only 8 operations.</p>
<p>To compile the tlr VM, follow these steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p class="first">get a fresh checkout of the <a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/branch/oo-jit/">oo-jit branch</a>, i.e. the branch
where the CLI JIT development goes on:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ svn co https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/branch/oo-jit
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">go to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">oo-jit/pypy/jit/tl</span> <span class="pre">directory</span></tt>, and compile the tlr VM
with the CLI backend and JIT enabled:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cd oo-jit/pypy/jit/tl/
$ ../../translator/goal/translate.py -b cli --jit --batch targettlr
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal of our test program is to compute the square of a given
number; since the only operations supported by the VM are addition and
negation, we compute the result by doing repetitive additions; I won't
describe the exact meaning of all the tlr bytecodes here, as they are
quite self-documenting:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ALLOCATE,    3,   # make space for three registers
MOV_A_R,     0,   # i = a
MOV_A_R,     1,   # copy of 'a'

SET_A,       0,
MOV_A_R,     2,   # res = 0

# 10:
SET_A,       1,
NEG_A,
ADD_R_TO_A,  0,
MOV_A_R,     0,   # i--

MOV_R_A,     2,
ADD_R_TO_A,  1,
MOV_A_R,     2,   # res += a

MOV_R_A,     0,
JUMP_IF_A,  10,   # if i!=0: goto 10

MOV_R_A,     2,
RETURN_A          # return res
</pre>
<p>You can find the program also at the end of the <a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist/pypy/jit/tl/tlr.py">tlr</a> module; to get an
assembled version of the bytecode, ready to be interpreted, run this
command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ python tlr.py assemble &gt; square.tlr
</pre>
<p>Now, we are ready to execute the code through the tlr VM; if you are
using Linux/Mono, you can simply execute the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">targettlr-cli</span></tt> script
that has been created for you; however, if you use Windows, you have
to manually fish the executable inside the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">targettlr-cli-data</span></tt>
directory:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# Linux
$ ./targettlr-cli square.tlr 16
256

# Windows
&gt; targettlr-cli-data\main.exe square.tlr 16
256
</pre>
<p>Cool, our program computed the result correctly! But, how can we be
sure that it really JIT compiled our code instead of interpreting it?
To inspect the code that it's generated by our JIT compiler, we simply
set the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PYPYJITLOG</span></tt> environment variable to a filename, so that the
JIT will create a .NET assembly containing all the code that has been
generated by the JIT:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ PYPYJITLOG=generated.dll ./targettlr-cli square.tlr 16
256
$ file generated.dll
generated.dll: MS-DOS executable PE  for MS Windows (DLL) (console) Intel 80386 32-bit
</pre>
<p>Now, we can inspect the DLL with any IL disassembler, such as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ilasm</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">monodis</span></tt>; here is an excerpt of the disassembled code,
that shows how our <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">square.tlr</span></tt> bytecode has been compiled to .NET
bytecode:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.method public static  hidebysig default int32 invoke (object[] A_0, int32 A_1)  cil managed
{
    .maxstack 3
    .locals init (int32 V_0, int32 V_1, int32 V_2, int32 V_3, int32 V_4, int32 V_5)

    ldc.i4 -1
    ldarg.1
    add
    stloc.1
    ldc.i4 0
    ldarg.1
    add
    stloc.2
    IL_0010:  ldloc.1
    ldc.i4.0
    cgt.un
    stloc.3
    ldloc.3
    brfalse IL_003b

    ldc.i4 -1
    ldloc.1
    add
    stloc.s 4
    ldloc.2
    ldarg.1
    add
    stloc.s 5
    ldloc.s 5
    stloc.2
    ldloc.s 4
    stloc.1
    ldarg.1
    starg 1

    nop
    nop
    br IL_0010

    IL_003b:  ldloc.2
    stloc.0
    br IL_0042

    ldloc.0
    ret
}
</pre>
<p>If you know a bit IL, you can see that the code generated is not
optimal, as there are some redundant operations like all those
stloc/ldloc pairs; however, while not optimal, it is still quite good
code, not much different to what you would get by writing the square
algorithm directly in e.g. C#.</p>
<p>As I said before, all of this is still work in progress and there is
still much to be done. Stay tuned :-).</p>

    <p>Recently, thanks to Amaury Forgeot d'Arc and Michael Schneider, Windows became more of a first-class platform for PyPy's Python interpreter. Most RPython extension modules are now considered <a href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/config/objspace.allworkingmodules.html">working</a> (apart from some POSIX specific modules). Even CTypes now works on windows!
<br><br>
Next step would be to have better <a href="https://pypy.intarweb.us/">buildbot</a> support for all supported platforms (Windows, Linux and OS X), so we can control and react to regressions quickly. (Buildbot is maintained by <a href="https://jcalderone.livejournal.com/">JP Calderone</a>)

    <p>Trying to give some notes about the <a class="reference" href="https://www.swa.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/s3/index.html">S3 Workshop</a> in Potsdam that several
PyPyers and Spies (Armin, Carl Friedrich, Niko, Toon, Adrian) attended before
the Berlin sprint.  We presented a <a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/paper/spy-s3.pdf">paper</a> about SPy there. Below are some mostly
random note about my (Carl Friedrich's) impressions of the conference and some
talk notes. Before that I'd like to give thanks to the organizers who did a
great job. The workshop was well organized, the social events were wonderful (a
very relaxing boat trip in the many lakes around Potsdam and a conference
dinner).</p>
<p>Video recordings of all the talks can be found on the <a class="reference" href="https://www.swa.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/s3/program/index.html">program page</a>.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="invited-talks" name="invited-talks">Invited Talks</a></h2>
<p>"Late-bound Object Lambda Architectures" by Ian Piumarta was quite an inspiring
talk about <a class="reference" href="../posts/2008/05/s3-workshop-potsdam-2008-writeup-6610637452403831794.html#vpri">VPRI</a>'s attempt at writing a flexible and understandable computing
system in 20K lines of code. The talk was lacking a bit in technical details, so
while it was inspiring I couldn't really say much about their implementation.
Apart from that, I disagree with some of their goals, but that's the topic of
another blog post.</p>
<p id="vpri">"The Lively Kernel â€“ A Self-supporting System on a Web Page" by Dan Ingalls. Dan
Ingalls is one of the inventors of the original Smalltalk and of Squeak. He was
talking about his latest work, the attempts of bringing a Squeak-like system to
a web browser using JavaScript and SVG. To get some feel for what exactly <a class="reference" href="https://research.sun.com/projects/lively/">The
Lively Kernel</a> is, it is easiest to just <a class="reference" href="https://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/0.8.5/index.xhtml">try it out</a> (only works in Safari
and Firefox 3 above Beta 5 though). I guess in a sense the progress of the
Lively Kernel over Squeak is not that great but Dan seems to be having fun.  Dan
is an incredibly enthusiastic, friendly and positive person, it was really great
meeting him. He even seemed to like some of the ideas in SPy.</p>
<p>"On Sustaining Self" by Richard P. Gabriel was a sort of deconstructivist
multi-media-show train wreck of a presentation that was a bit too weird for my
taste. There was a lot of music, there were sections in the presentation
where Richard discussed with an alter ego, whose part he had recorded in advance
and mangled with a sound editor. There was a large bit of a documentary
about <a class="reference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levittown,_New_York">Levittown</a>. Even the introduction and the questions were weird, with Pascal
Constanza staring down the audience, without saying a word (nobody dared to ask
questions). I am not sure I saw the point of the presentation, apart from
getting the audience to think, which probably worked. It seems that there are
people (e.g. <a class="reference" href="https://chneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2008/05/workshop-on-self-sustaining-systems-2008.html">Christian Neukirchen</a>) that liked the presentation, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="research-papers" name="research-papers">Research Papers</a></h2>
<p>"SBCL - A Sanely Bootstrappable Common Lisp by Christophe Rhodes described the
bootstrapping process of <a class="reference" href="https://sbcl.org">SBCL</a> (Steel Bank Common Lisp). SBCL can be bootstrapped
by a variety of Common Lisps, not just by itself. SBCL contains a complete
blueprint of the initial image instead of always getting the new image by
carefully mutating the old one. This bootstrapping approach is sort of similar
to that of PyPy.</p>
<p>"Reflection for the Masses" by Charlotte Herzeel, Pascal Costanza, and Theo
D'Hondt retraced some of the work of Brian Smith on reflection in Lisp. The
talk was not very good, it was way too long (40 min), quite hard to understand
because Charlotte Herzeel was talking in a very low voice. The biggest mistake
in her talk was in my opinion that she spent too much time explaining a more or
less standard meta-circular interpreter for Lisp and then running out of time
when she was trying to explain the modifications. I guess it would have been a
fair assumptions that large parts of the audience know such interpreters, so
glossing over the details would have been fine. A bit of a pity, since the paper
seems interesting.</p>
<p>"Back to the Future in One Week - Implementing a Smalltalk VM in PyPy"
by Carl Friedrich Bolz, Adrian Kuhn, Adrian Lienhard, Nicholas D. Matsakis,
Oscar Nierstrasz, Lukas Renggli, Armin Rigo and Toon Verwaest, the paper with
the longest author list. We just made everybody an author who was at the sprint
in Bern. Our <a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/paper/spy-s3.pdf">paper</a> had more authors than all the other papers together :-). I
gave the <a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/s3-2008/talk.pdf">presentation</a> at the workshop, which went quite well, judging from the
feedback I got.</p>
<p>"Huemul - A Smalltalk Implementation" by Guillermo AdriÃ¡n Molina. <a class="reference" href="https://www.guillermomolina.com.ar/huemul/">Huemul</a> is a
Smalltalk implementation that doesn't contain an interpreter but directly
compiles all methods to assembler (and also saves the assembler in the image).
In addition, as much functionality (such as threading, GUI) as possible is
delegated to libraries instead of reimplementing them in Smalltalk
(as e.g. Squeak is doing). The approach seems to suffer from the usual problems
of manually writing a JIT, e.g. the VM seems to segfault pretty often. Also I
don't agree with some of the design decisions of the threading scheme, there is
no automatic locking of objects at all, instead the user code is responsible for
preventing concurrent accesses from messing up things (which even seems to lead
to segfaults in the default image).</p>
<p>"Are Bytecodes an Atavism?" by Theo D'Hondt argued that using AST-based
interpreters can be as fast as bytecode-based interpreters which he proved by
writing two AST-interpreters, one for <a class="reference" href="https://pico.vub.ac.be/">Pico</a> and one for Scheme. Both of these
implementations seem to perform pretty well. Theo seems to have many similar
views as PyPy, for example that writing simple straightforward interpreters is
often preferable than writing complex (JIT-)compilers.</p>

    <p>The Berlin sprint is finished, below some notes on what we worked on during
the last three days:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Camillo worked tirelessly on the gameboy emulator with some occasional input
by various people. He is making good progress, some test ROMs run now on the
translated emulator. However, the graphics are still not completely working
for unclear reasons. Since <a class="reference" href="https://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13824">PyBoy</a> is already taken as a project name, we
considered calling it PyGirl (another name proposition was "BoyBoy", but the
implementation is not circular enough for that).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On Monday Armin and Samuele fixed the problem with our multimethods so that
the builtin shortcut works again (the builtin shortcut is an optimization
that speeds up all operations on builtin non-subclassed types quite a bit).</li>
<li>Antonio and Holger (who hasn't been on a sprint in a while, great to have you
back!) worked on writing a conftest file (the plugin mechanism of py.test)
that would allow us to run Django tests using py.test, which seems to be not
completely trivial. They also fixed some bugs in PyPy's Python interpreter,
e.g. related to dictionary subclassing.</li>
<li>Karl started adding sound support to the RPython SDL-bindings, which will be
needed both by the Gameboy emulator and eventually by the SPy VM.</li>
<li>Armin and Maciek continued the work that Maciek had started a while ago of
improving the speed of PyPy's IO operation. In the past, doing IO usually
involved copying lots of memory around, which should have improved now. Armin
and Maciek improved and then merged the first of the two branches that
contained IO improvements, which speeds up IO on non-moving GCs (mostly the
Boehm GC). Then they continued working on the hybrid-io branch which is
supposed improve IO on the hybrid GC (which was partially designed exactly
for this).</li>
<li>Toon, Carl Friedrich finished cleaning up the SPy improvement branch and
fixed all warnings that occur when you translate SPy there. An obscure bug in
an optimization prevented them from getting working executables, which at
this moment blocks the merging of that branch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By now everybody is home again (except for Anto, who booked his return flight
two days too late, accidentally) and mostly resting. It was a good sprint, with
some interesting results and several new people joining. And it was definitely
the most unusual sprint location ever :-).</p>

    <p>After having survived the S3-Workshop which took place in Potsdam on Thursday
and Friday (a blog-post about this will follow later) we are now sitting in the
c-base in Berlin, happily sprinting. Below are some notes on what progress we
made so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Gameboy emulator in RPython that Camillo Bruni is working on for his
Bachelor project at Uni Bern does now translate. It took him (assisted by
various people) a while to figure out the translation errors (essentially
because he wrote nice Python code that passed bound methods around, which the
RTyper doesn't completely like).  Now that is fixed and the Gameboy emulator
translates and runs a test ROM.  You cannot really see anything yet, because
there is no graphics support in RPython.</li>
<li>To get graphics support in RPython Armin and Karl started writing SDL
bindings for RPython, which both the Gameboy emulator and the SPy VM need.
They have basic stuff working, probably enough to support the Gameboy
already.</li>
<li>Alexander, Armin, Maciek and Samuele discussed how to approach separate
compilation for RPython, which isn't easy because the RPython type analysis
is a whole-program analysis.</li>
<li>Stephan, Peter and Adrian (at least in the beginning) worked on making PyPy's
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stackless</span></tt> module more complete. They added channel preferences which
change details of the scheduling semantics.</li>
<li>Toon, Carl Friedrich and Adrian (a tiny bit) worked on SPy. There is a branch
that Toon started a while ago which contains many improvements but is also
quite unclear in many respects. There was some progress in cleaning that up.
This involved implementing the Smalltalk process scheduler (Smalltalk really
is an OS). There is still quite some work left though. While doing so, we
discovered many funny facts about Squeak's implementation details (most of
which are exposed to the user) in the process. I guess we should collect them
and blog about them eventually.</li>
<li>Samuele and Maciek improved the ctypes version of pysqlite that Gerhard
HÃ¤ring started.</li>
<li>Armin, Samuele and Maciek found an obscure bug in the interaction between the
builtin-type-shortcut that Armin recently implemented and our multimethod
implementation. It's not clear which of the two are to blame, however it
seems rather unclear how to fix the problem: Armin and Samuele are stuck in a
discussion about how to approach a solution since a while and are hard to
talk to.</li>
<li>Stijn Timbermont, a Ph.D. student at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel who is
visiting the sprint for two days was first looking at how our GCs are
implemented to figure out whether he can use PyPy for some experiments. The
answer to that seems to be no. Today he was hacking on a Pico interpreter
(without knowing too much about Python) and is making some nice progress, it
seems.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>During the past two weeks we invested some more efforts on the
baseline performance of pypy-c.  Some of the tweaks we did
were just new ideas, and others were based on actual
profiling.  The net outcome is that we now expect PyPy to be
in the worst case twice as slow than CPython on real
applications.  Here are some small-to-medium-size benchmark
results.  The number is the execution time, normalized to 1.0
for CPython 2.4:</p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>1.90</strong> on templess (a simple templating language)</li>
<li>
<strong>1.49</strong> on gadfly (pure Python SQL database)</li>
<li>
<strong>1.49</strong> on translate.py (pypy's own translation toolchain)</li>
<li>
<strong>1.44</strong> on mako (another templating system)</li>
<li>
<strong>1.21</strong> on pystone</li>
<li>
<strong>0.78</strong> on richards</li>
</ul>
<p>(This is all without the JIT, as usual.  The JIT is not ready yet.)</p>

<p>You can build yourself a pypy-c with this kind of speed with
the magic command line (gcrootfinder is only for a 32-bit
Linux machine):</p>

<p></p>
<pre>    pypy/translator/goal/translate.py --gc=hybrid --gcrootfinder=asmgcc targetpypystandalone --allworkingmodules --faassen</pre>

<p>The main improvements come from:
    
</p>
<ul>
<li>A general shortcut for any operation between built-in objects:
for example, a subtraction of two integers or floats now dispatches
directly to the integer or float subtraction code, without looking up
the '__sub__' in the class.</li>
<li>A shortcut for getting attributes out of instances of user classes
when the '__getattribute__' special method is not overridden.</li>
<li>The so-called Hybrid Garbage Collector is now a
three-generations collector.
<a href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/garbage_collection.html">
More about our GCs...</a>
</li>
<li>Some profiling showed bad performance in our implementation of
the built-in id() -- a trivial function to write in CPython, but a lot
more fun when you have a moving GC and your object's real address can
change.</li>
<li>The bytecode compiler's parser had a very slow linear search
algorithm that we replaced with a dictionary lookup.</li>
</ul>
<p>These benchmarks are doing CPU-intensive operations. You can expect
a similar blog post soon about the I/O performance, as the
<code>io-improvements</code> branch gets closer to being merged
<code>:-)</code>  The branch could also improve the speed of
string operations, as used e.g. by the templating systems.</p>

          <p>There are actually two dictionaries, at least when using one of the generational GCs: one for the first generation objects and one for the rest.  The dictionary for the rest of the objects can probably get quite large, but it needs to be traversed once during each full collection only.  It seems that full collections are rare enough: the full dictionary updating doesn't stand out in profiled runs.<br><br>I didn't think about implementing id() at the language level, e.g. by extending the class of the object to add a field. <br>We can't really do that in RPython.  Moreover, that seems impractical for Python: if someone asks for the id() of an integer object, do all integers suddenly need to grow an 'id' field?</p>

          <p>Note that current benchmarks suggest that CPython 3.0 is yet much slower than CPython 2.x. It might be interesting to see whether this means that PyPy is much faster than CPython 3.0 running e.g. Pystone. <br>Of course this fact would not be very surprising, esp. given that PyPy does not implement any CPy3k features.</p>

    <p>Our next PyPy sprint will take place in the crashed <a href="https://www.c-base.org/">c-base space station</a>, Berlin, Germany, Earth, Solar System.  This is a fully public sprint: newcomers (from all planets) are welcome.  Suggestion of topics (other topics are welcome too):</p>

<ul>
<li>work on PyPy's JIT generator: we are refactoring parts of the
    compiling logic, in ways that may also allow generating better
    machine code for loops (people or aliens with knowledge on
    compilers and SSA, welcome)

</li>
<li>work on the SPy VM, PyPy's Squeak implementation, particularly the
    graphics capabilities                                             

</li>
<li>work on PyPy's GameBoy emulator, which also needs graphics support
                                                                      
</li>
<li>trying some large pure-Python applications or libraries on PyPy and
    fixing the resulting bugs. Possibilities are Zope 3, Django and
    others.

    <p>Recently, we taught the JIT x86 backend how to produce code for the x87 floating point coprocessor. This means that JIT is able to nicely speed up float operations <b>(this this is not true for our Python interpreter yet - we did not integrate it yet)</b>. This is the first time we started going beyond what is feasible in <a href="https://psyco.sourceforge.net">psyco</a> - it would take a lot of effort to make floats working on top of psyco, way more than it will take on PyPy.
<br><br>
This work is in very early stage and lives on a <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/branch/jit-hotpath">jit-hotpath branch</a>, which includes all our recent experiments on JIT compiler generation, including tracing JIT experiments and huge JIT refactoring.
<br><br>
Because we don't encode the Python's semantics in our JIT (which is really a JIT generator), it is expected that our Python interpreter with a JIT will become fast "suddenly", when our JIT generator is good enough. If this point is reached, we  would also get fast interpreters for Smalltalk or JavaScript with relatively low effort.
<br><br>
Stay tuned.

          <p>I'm interested in the choice of x87 as well. My understanding was that Intel (at least) was keeping x87 floating point around because of binary applications but that for single element floating point the SSE single-element instructions were the preferred option on any processor which supports SSE. (Unfortunately since they've got such different styles of programming I can understand if it's just that "older chips have to be supported, and we've only got enough programming manpower for 1 implementation".)</p>

          <p>The main backend is the one for 386.  We have no working LLVM JIT backend: although llvm advertizes supporting JIT compilation, what it really provides is a regular compiler packaged as a library that can be used at run-time.  This is only suitable for some kinds of usages; for example, it couldn't be used to write a Java VM with good just-in-time optimizations (which need e.g. quick and lazy code generation and regeneration, polymorphic inline caches, etc.)</p>
