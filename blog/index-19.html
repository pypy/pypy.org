    <p>Image processing is notoriously a CPU intensive task.  To do it in realtime,
you need to implement your algorithm in a fast language, hence trying to do it
in Python is foolish: Python is clearly not fast enough for this task. Is it?
:-)<br>
Actually, it turns out that the PyPy JIT compiler produces code which is fast
enough to do realtime video processing using two simple algorithms implemented
by Håkan Ardö.<br><tt class="docutils literal">sobel.py</tt> implements a classical way of locating edges in images, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator">Sobel operator</a>. It is an approximation of the magnitude of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_gradient">image
gradient</a>. The processing time is spend on two <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">convolutions</a> between the
image and 3x3-kernels.<br><tt class="docutils literal">magnify.py</tt> implements a pixel coordinate transformation that rearranges
the pixels in the image to form a magnifying effect in the center.
It consists of a single loop over the pixels in the output image copying
pixels from the input image.<br>
You can try by yourself by downloading the appropriate demo:<br></p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://wyvern.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/%7Eantocuni/pypy-image-demo.tar.bz2">pypy-image-demo.tar.bz2</a>: this archive contains only the source code,
use this is you have PyPy already installed</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://wyvern.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/%7Eantocuni/pypy-image-demo-full.tar.bz2">pypy-image-demo-full.tar.bz2</a>: this archive contains both the source
code and prebuilt PyPy binaries for linux 32 and 64 bits</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
To run the demo, you need to have <tt class="docutils literal">mplayer</tt> installed on your system.  The
demo has been tested only on linux, it might (or not) work also on other
systems:<br><pre class="literal-block">$ pypy pypy-image-demo/sobel.py

$ pypy pypy-image-demo/magnify.py
</pre>
By default, the two demos uses an example AVI file.  To have more fun, you can
use your webcam by passing the appropriate mplayer parameters to the scripts,
e.g:<br><pre class="literal-block">$ pypy demo/sobel.py tv://
</pre>
By default magnify.py uses <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_interpolation">nearest-neighbor interpolation</a>.  By adding the
option -b, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation">bilinear interpolation</a> will be used instead, which gives
smoother result:<br><pre class="literal-block">$ pypy demo/magnify.py -b
</pre>
There is only a single implementation of the algorithm in
<tt class="docutils literal">magnify.py</tt>. The two different interpolation methods are implemented by
subclassing the class used to represent images and embed the
interpolation within the pixel access method. PyPy is able to achieve good
performance with this kind of abstractions because it can inline
the pixel access method and specialize the implementation of the algorithm.
In C++ that kind of pixel access method would be virtual and you'll need to use
templates to get the same effect without incurring in runtime overhead.<br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">




</div>
The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DtlBC_Zbq4">video</a> above shows PyPy and CPython running <tt class="docutils literal">sobel.py</tt> side by
side (PyPy taking input from the webcam, CPython from the test
file). Alternatively, to have a feeling on how much PyPy is faster than
CPython, try to run the demo with the latter.  These are the the average fps
(frames per second) that I get on my machine (Ubuntu 64 bit, Intel i7 920, 4GB
RAM) when processing the default <tt class="docutils literal">test.avi</tt> video and using the prebuilt
PyPy binary found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://wyvern.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/%7Eantocuni/pypy-image-demo-full.tar.bz2">full</a> tarball alinked above.  For <tt class="docutils literal">sobel.py</tt>:<br><blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyPy: ~47.23 fps</li>
<li>CPython: ~0.08 fps</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
For <tt class="docutils literal">magnify.py</tt>:<br><blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyPy: ~26.92 fps</li>
<li>CPython: ~1.78 fps</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
This means that on <tt class="docutils literal">sobel.py</tt>, PyPy is <b>590 times faster</b>.  On
<tt class="docutils literal">magnify.py</tt> the difference is much less evident and the speedup is "only"
15x.<br>
It must be noted that this is an extreme example of what PyPy can do.  In
particular, you cannot expect (yet :-)) PyPy to be fast enough to run an
arbitrary video processing algorithm in real time, but the demo still proves
that PyPy has the potential to get there.

          <p>Other Anonymous: Yes, I can read. I should have given a bit more context, but I was offtopic anyway. My goal was not running the demo, my goal was running pypy. I used the OS X binary from pypy.org. For those who are really good at reading, this was probably clear from the fact that my binary only crashed at library loading time.</p>

          <p>Antonio: Thanks for the quick reply.

          <p>Hello,<br><br>it's lovely that pypy can do this.  This result is amazing, wonderful, and is very kittens.  pypy is fast at running python code (*happy dance*).<br><br>But.<br><br>It also makes kittens cry when you compare to CPython in such a way.<br><br>The reality is that CPython users would do this using a library like numpy, opencv, pygame, scipy, pyopengl, freej (the list of real time video processing python libraries is very large, so I won't list them all here).<br><br>Of course python can do this task well, and has for more than 10 years.<br><br>This code does not take advantage of vectorization through efficient SIMD, multiple cores or graphics hardware, and isn't careful with reusing memory - so is not within an order of magnitude of the speed of CPython code with libraries doing real time video processing.  <br><br>Anyone within the field would ask about using these features.<br><br>Another question they would ask is about pauses. How does the JIT affect pauses in animation? What are the rules for when the JIT warms up, and how can you tell when the code will start running fast? How does the GC affect pauses?  If there is a way to turn off the GC, or reuse memory in some way such that the GC won't cause the program to fail(Remember that in realtime a pause is a program fail).  Does the GC pool memory of similar size objects automatically?  Does the GC work well with 256MB-1GB-16GB sized objects?  In a 16GB system, can you use 15GB of objects, and then delete those objects to then use another 15GB of different objects?  Or will the program swap, or fragment memory causing pauses?<br><br>Please don't make kittens cry.  Be realistic with CPython comparisons.<br><br><br>At the moment the python implementation is not as elegant as a vector style implementation.  A numpy/matlab/CUDA/OpenCL approach looks really nice for this type of code.  One speed up might be to reuse memory, or act in place where possible.  For example, not copying the image... unless the GC magically takes care of that for you.</p>

          <p>@illume:More or less everyone knows that you can speed up your code by writing or using an extension library. Unfortunately this introduces a dependency on the library (for instance libssl mentioned in the comment thread) and it usually increases the complexity of your code.<br><br>Using PyPy you can solve computationally intensive problems in plain Python. Writing in Python saves development time. This is what the comparison is all about.</p>

          <p>hi @jacob: below is code which runs either multi core, vectorised SIMD, and on a GPU if you like.

This is just comparing CPU based code.  Obviously GPU code for real time image processing is very fast compared to CPU based code.<br><br>Things like numpy, pyopengl etc come packaged with various OSes - but chosing those dependencies compared to depending on pypy is a separate issue I guess (but many cpython packaged libraries are packaged for more platforms than pypy).<br><br>Of course using tested, and debugged existing code written in python will save you development time:  for example using sobel written with the scipy library:<br>https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.filters.sobel.html<br><br>The fact is CPython is fast enough, more elegant, and will save you time for realtime image processing - unless you ignore the reality that people use CPython libraries for these tasks.<br><br>Finally the given code does not prove that the frames are all processed in realtime.  They give an average time over all of the frames.  Realtime video requires that you meet your target speed for every frame.

          <p>I think you are still missing the point of the post.  It was not "use pure Python to write your video processing algos".  That's of course nonsense, given the amount and quality of existing C extension modules to do that.<br><br>The point is that when you want to experiment with writing a new algorithm of any kind, it is now possible to do it in pure Python instead of, say, C code.  If later your project needs to move past the experimentation phase, you will have to decide if you want to keep that Python code, rewrite it in C, or (if applicable) use SIMD instructions from Python or from C, or whatever.<br><br>The real point of this demo is to show that PyPy makes Python fast enough as an early experimentation platform for almost any kind of algorithm.  If you can write in Python instead of in C, you'll save 50% of your time (random estimate); and then for the 5% of projects that go past the experimentation phase and where Python is not enough (other random estimate), spend more time learning other techniques and using them.  The result is still in your favor, and it's only going to be more so as PyPy continues to improve.</p>

    <p>People that listened to my (Armin Rigo) lightning talk at EuroPython know that
suddenly, we have a plan to remove the Global Interpreter Lock --- the
infamous GIL, the thing in CPython that prevents multiple threads from
actually running in your Python code in parallel.</p>
<p>That's not actually new, because Jython has been doing it all along.
Jython works by very carefully adding locks to
all the mutable built-in types, and by relying on the underlying Java
platform to be efficient about them (so that the result is faster than,
say, very carefully adding similar locks in CPython).  By "very
carefully", I mean <em>really</em> <em>really</em> carefully; for example,
'dict1.update(dict2)' needs to lock both dict1 and dict2, but if you do
it naively, then a parallel 'dict2.update(dict1)' might cause a
deadlock.</p>
<p>All of PyPy, CPython and IronPython have a GIL.  But for PyPy we are considering
a quite different approach than Jython's, based on <a class="reference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">Software
Transactional Memory</a>.  This is a recent development in computer
science, and it gives a nicer solution than locking.  Here is a short
introduction to it.</p>
<p>Say you want to atomically pop an item from 'list1' and append it to
'list2':</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f(list1, list2):
    x = list1.pop()
    list2.append(x)
</pre>
<p>This is not safe in multithreaded cases (even with the GIL).  Say that
you call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f(l1,</span> <span class="pre">l2)</span></tt> in thread 1 and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f(l2,</span> <span class="pre">l1)</span></tt> in thread 2.  What
you want is that it has no effect at all (x is moved from one list to
the other, then back).  But what can occur is that instead the top of
the two lists are swapped, depending on timing issues.</p>
<p>One way to fix it is with a global lock:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f(list1, list2):
    global_lock.acquire()
    x = list1.pop()
    list2.append(x)
    global_lock.release()
</pre>
<p>A finer way to fix it is with locks that come with the lists:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f(list1, list2):
    acquire_all_locks(list1.lock, list2.lock)
    x = list1.pop()
    list2.append(x)
    release_all_locks(list1.lock, list2.lock)
</pre>
<p>The second solution is a model for Jython's, while the first is a model
for CPython's.  Indeed, in CPython's interpreter, we acquire the GIL,
then we do one bytecode (or actually a number of them, like 100), then
we release the GIL; and then we proceed to the next bunch of 100.</p>
<p>Software Transactional Memory (STM) gives a third solution:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f(list1, list2):
    while True:
        t = transaction()
        x = list1.pop(t)
        list2.append(t, x)
        if t.commit():
            break
</pre>
<p>In this solution, we make a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">transaction</span></tt> object and use it in all
reads and writes we do to the lists.  There are actually several
different models, but let's focus on one of them.  During a transaction,
we don't actually change the global memory at all.  Instead, we use the
thread-local <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">transaction</span></tt> object.  We store in it which objects we
read from, which objects we write to, and what values we write.  It is
only when the transaction reaches its end that we attempt to "commit"
it.  Committing might fail if other commits have occurred in between,
creating inconsistencies; in that case, the transaction aborts and
must restart from the beginning.</p>
<p>In the same way as the previous two solutions are models for CPython and
Jython, the STM solution looks like it could be a model for PyPy in the
future.  In such a PyPy, the interpreter would start a transaction, do
one or several bytecodes, and then end the transaction; and repeat.
This is very similar to what is going on in CPython with the GIL.  In
particular, it means that it gives programmers all the same guarantees
as the GIL does.  The <em>only</em> difference is that it can actually run
multiple threads in parallel, as long as their code does not interfere
with each other.  (In particular, if you need not just the GIL but actual
locks in your existing multi-threaded program, then this will not
magically remove the need for them.  You might get an additional built-in
module that exposes STM to your Python programs, if you prefer it over
locks, but that's another question.)</p>
<p>Why not apply that idea to CPython?  Because we would need to change
everything everywhere.  In the example above, you may have noted that I
no longer call 'list1.pop()', but 'list1.pop(t)'; this is a way to tell
that the implementation of all the methods needs to be changed, in order
to do their work "transactionally".  This means that instead of really
changing the global memory in which the list is stored, it must instead
record the change in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">transation</span></tt> object.  If our interpreter is
written in C, as CPython is, then we need to write it explicitly
everywhere.  If it is written instead in a higher-level language, as
PyPy is, then we can add this behavior as as set of translation rules, and
apply them automatically wherever it is necessary.  Moreover, it can be
a translation-time option: you can either get the current "pypy" with a
GIL, or a version with STM, which would be slower due to the extra
bookkeeping.  (How much slower?  I have no clue, but as a wild guess,
maybe between 2 and 5 times slower.  That is fine if you have enough
cores, as long as it scales nicely :-)</p>
<p>A final note: as STM research is very recent (it started around 2003),
there are a number of variants around, and it's not clear yet which one
is better in which cases.  As far as I can tell, the approach described
in "A Comprehensive Strategy for Contention Management in Software
Transactional Memory" seems to be one possible state-of-the-art; it also
seems to be "good enough for all cases".</p>
<p>So, when will it be done?  I cannot say yet.  It is still at the idea
stage, but I <em>think</em> that it can work.  How long would it take us to
write it?  Again no clue, but we are looking at many months rather
than many days.  This is the sort of thing that I would
like to be able to work on full time after the <a class="reference" href="../posts/2010/12/oh-and-btw-pypy-gets-funding-through-3568486750776147382.html">Eurostars funding</a>
runs out on September 1.  We are currently looking at ways to use
<a class="reference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_funding">crowdfunding</a> to raise money so that I can do exactly that.  Expect
a blog post about that very soon.  But this looks like a perfect
candidate for crowdfunding -- there are at least thousands of you who
would be willing to pay 10s of Euros to Kill the GIL.  Now we only
have to make this happen.</p>

          <p>@Michael Foord: In state-of-the-art lazy[1] STM systems, the probability of two transactions continually causing each other to restart is minuscule. A transaction only causes another one to restart when it tries to commit. So when somebody restarts, it means that someone else has successfully committed.<br><br>[1] In "Lazy" STMs, transactions only get exclusive access to the things they're trying to write to for a very short window of time at the end. This means they have to record writes in a transaction log,  as Armin described, because there might be many pending writes for the same object. An alternative design is "eager" STM, where transactions write directly and have to "undo" their writes if they get aborted. Eager systems look good on paper, but in my opinion they're not worth it. With eager STM, the runtime system has to be very carefully designed to avoid livelock (when the system hangs because some transactions constantly abort each other). Lazy STM is almost impossible to livelock in practice, because even if some transactions are highly conflicting at least one of them (almost always) has to commit.</p>

          <p>@Richard: reading the web page you point out, Microsoft's STM attempt (like most others I'm aware of) seems to work at a different level: basically as a library for application programmers.  I can go through all 4 points and show why they are not relevant in our context:<br><br>* any visible I/O (e.g. writing to a file or a log) is going to end the transaction and start the next one, just like the GIL is released and re-acquired around most calls to the C library's write() function<br><br>* the 2nd issue is moot, because STM will be an internal detail in PyPy, not a user-visible feature<br><br>* the 3nd issue he describes is about "update-in-place" STM, which I believe is not the best solution: we want instead to keep a local log of the changes, and apply them only at commit-time (as described e.g. in the paper I pointed out)<br><br>* the final issue is the lack of real successes with STM.  Well, we can't do anything about that ahead of time :-)</p>

          <p>To address the anonymous question near the start of the comments, one way to detect commit collision is to copy a global generation counter at the start of your transaction, and then compare your stored copy to the current generation counter at commit time (after taking a lock), and if no one else has incremented the generation counter, you do so and complete your operation.<br><br>So transaction does:<br>  self.generation = global.generation<br><br>And commit does:<br>  if lock(global.lock):<br>    if self.generation == global.generation:<br>      global.generation += 1<br>      return True<br>  unlock(global.lock)<br>  return False</p>

          <p>@⚛: That's kind of how parallelization goes. There <i>are</i> overheads, and the only way to make up for them is to hope you have enough parallel speedup. STM (and any approach to this problem based on fine-grained locking) would work best if only a small known set of objects are shared between threads, and only those are synchronized, which unfortunately cannot be the case for a general GIL-removal proposal.<br><br>However I think PyPy's JIT could potentially help a little here. The escape analysis PyPy already does can also prove "this value cannot be accessed by another thread" and used to avoid logging some values, since they cannot conflict with parallel transactions. There are probably some more STM-specific optimizations the JIT could do as well.</p>

          <p>@Michael Foord: STM definitely can be made as fine-grained as you like. Some existing STM systems operate at the level of machine words. Given that this one will be operating at the interpreter level, I would guess that code working on different sections of the same object (or array) would able to run in parallel, but I guess it depends on how the tradeoffs play out.</p>

          <p>@⚛: to complete Ben's answer: yes, you are correct, but that's why the translation step "insert STM logic" is never going to be mandatory.  You will get either a regular pypy-c-gil or a pypy-c-stm, as two different executables, and you will choose the one most suited for your particular program.  I still expect pypy-c-gil to be the most used one, with pypy-c-stm an alternative that is only useful for people with massively multi-threaded programs.</p>

          <p>I love this idea.<br><br>Just musing on an implementation detail here, but isn't the "lazy" STM implementation's transaction system effectively just an in-memory implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write" rel="nofollow">copy-on-write</a> semantics? It might be interesting to take a look at other things that have used COW for inspiration. (ZFS and btrfs come to mind) I like the idea that committing a transaction for a given object would just involve changing the object's address in memory to the modified copy.<br><br>Also, I'd be interested to see the read/write lock system get implemented, because it seems like it might be a better choice for programs that only use a couple threads.</p>

          <p>@Armin Rigo: If the problem for the RW-lock approach in CPython is just about reference count updates and checks, perhaps those could be done via atomic primitives, as supported on most modern architectures. This is what boost::shared_ptr does, IIRC, for the pointers to be thread-safe by default.</p>

          <p>@Skandalfo: right, indeed.  I don't know exactly the cost of such atomic operations.  Maybe it's fine, but I fear that doing tons of increfs/decrefs all the time (as needed for refcounts in CPython's simple interpreter) has an important cost.</p>

    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm here to report back the results of our survey. First, we're very pleased to
report that a number of you guys are happilly running PyPy in production! Most
(97%) of the respondants using PyPy are using it because it's faster, but a
further 26% (respondants could choose multiple answers) are using it because of
lower memory usage. Of users who aren't using PyPy, the most common reason was
C extensions, followed by "Other".</p>
<p>From reading the extra comments section there are a few things we've learned:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Google docs needs a better UI for this stuff</li>
<li>A huge number of people want NumPy and SciPy, it was easily the most
requested C extension (25% of respondants said somthing about NumPy). We've
already blogged on the topic of <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2011/05/numpy-in-pypy-status-and-roadmap-8332894230779779992.html">our plans for NumPy</a>.</li>
<li>Having packages in the various OS's repositories would be a big help in
getting users up and running.</li>
</ol>
<p>A huge thanks to everyone who responded! Finally, if you're using PyPy in
production we'd love to get a testimonial from you, if you're willing to spare
a few minutes to give us a quote or two please get in contact with us via <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">our
mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Alex</p>

          <p>@Marko Tasic: If I may ask a question. You wrote that you are using PyPy for highly reliable systems. I know what you mean, but it seems to me that certain features of Python are in contradiction with high reliability. For example, it is in practice impossible to know at compile-time whether you misspelled a variable or parameter in Python source code. My question would be: why are you using a language which has only rudimentary compile-time error detection to implement a high reliability system?</p>

While "Python can be used for X" or "Python can't be used for X, because ..." is not on topic.

    <p>The next PyPy sprint will be in Genova-Pegli, Italy, the week after <a href="https://ep2011.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a>
(which is in Florence, about 3h away by train). This is a fully public sprint:
newcomers and topics other than those proposed below are welcome.<br></p>
<div class="section" id="goals-and-topics-of-the-sprint">
<h1>

Goals and topics of the sprint</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="first">
Now that we have released 1.5, the sprint itself is going to be mainly
working on fixing issues reported by various users.  Possible topics
include, but are not limited to:</div>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>fixing issues in the bug tracker</li>
<li>improve cpyext, the C-API compatibility layer, to support more extension
modules</li>
<li>finish/improve/merge jitypes2, the branch which makes ctypes JIT friendly</li>
<li>general JIT improvements</li>
<li>improve our tools, like the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/jitviewer">jitviewer</a> or the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/buildbot/">buildbot</a> infrastructure</li>
<li>make your favorite module/application working on PyPy, if it doesn't yet</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<div class="first">
Of course this does not prevent people from showing up with a more precise
interest in mind  If there are newcomers, we will gladly give introduction
talks.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="first">
Since we are almost on the beach, we can take one day off for summer
relaxation and/or tourist visits nearby :-).</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exact-times">
<h1>

Exact times</h1>
The work days should be 27 June - 2 July 2011.  People may arrive on
the 26th already and/or leave on the 3rd.</div>

Genova-Pegli, Italy.  Pegli is a nice and peaceful little quarter of Genova,
and the hotel is directly on the beach, making it a perfect place for those
who want to enjoy the sea in the middle of the Italian summer, as a quick
<a href="https://images.google.com/images?q=genova%20pegli">search</a> on Google Images shows :-)<br><br>
The place has a good ADSL Internet connexion with wireless installed.  You can
of course arrange your own lodging anywhere but I definitely recommend lodging
there too.<br>
Please <i>confirm</i> that you are coming so that we can adjust the reservations as
appropriate.  The prices are as follows, and they include breakfast and a
parking place for the car, in case you need it:<br><blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>single room:  70 €</li>
<li>double room:  95 €</li>
<li>triple room: 105 €</li>
</ul>

          <p>Hi,<br><br>as for upcoming sprint... <br><br>The grid on https://speed.pypy.org/timeline/ is a totally great idea. However the benchmark tests listed represent no progress since a long time already. <br><br>Q1. Does it mean that the set is not representative any more and should be extended?<br><br>Q2. Is it possible to include some micro benchmarks, please? (Oh, please!)</p>

    <p>We've been working on PyPy for a long time. But readers of this blog will know
that in the past year something has changed: we think PyPy is production ready.
And it's not just us, this week <a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/">LWN.net</a> wrote an article about how <a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/442268/22f66371348bd7c5/">PyPy
sped up one of their scripts by a factor of three</a>, noting that, "plans are to
run gitdm under PyPy from here on out". All in all we think PyPy is pretty
great, but not everyone is using it yet, and we want to know why. We want your
feedback on why PyPy isn't ready to be your only Python yet, and how we can
improve it to make that happen.</p>
<p>Therefore, we've put together a quick survey, whether you're using PyPy or not
if you could take a few minutes to fill it out and let us know how we're doing
we'd really appreciate it. You can find the form <a class="reference external" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dF9NZlFpNldNS05fdFVKMnpKZVFzN0E6MQ#gid=0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks,
The PyPy team</p>

          <p>We are very interested in using PyPy in production but our project is based on lxml library and both are incompatible. Do you suggest any fix for this? I'm not sure if PyPy would compensate the reduction if performance of a pure Python XML library.</p>

          <p>Pypy needs to either be a dropin replacement for python or provide a significant (order of magnitude) difference in performance that moving to pypy won't be as big of a deal when you lose the support of so many 3rd party libraries.</p>

          <p>I'd love to use PyPy in some of my projects, but they rely on lots of 3rd-party C/C++-based libraries.<br><br>1) lxml, thats an absolute must for most of my applications.

          <p>Well, basically, it's NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and MayaVi. I'm also using Cython to optimize computation intensive code paths, but of course it would be nicer to stick to pure Python and let JIT do it's magic.</p>

    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>We are in the process of migrating the hosting machine for PyPy, moving away from <a href="https://codespeak.net">codespeak.net</a> and towards a mixture of custom servers (e.g. for <a href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/">buildbot.pypy.org</a>) and wide-scale services (e.g. for the docs, <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/">now at readthedocs.org</a>).</p>

<p>When this is done, a proper announce will be posted here.  In the meantime, we have already moved the mailing lists, now hosted on python.org.  The subscribers' list have been copied, so if you didn't notice anything special for the past week, then everything works fine :-)  This concerns <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">pypy-dev</a>, <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-issue">pypy-issue</a> and <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-commit">pypy-commit</a>.  Two notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some settings have not been copied, notably if you used to disable mail delivery.  Sorry about that; you have to re-enter such settings.
</li>
<li>Following the move, about 50 addresses have been dropped for being invalid.  I'm unsure why they were not dropped earlier, but in case sending mail to you from python.org instead of codespeak.net fails, then you have been dropped from the mailing lists, and you need to subscribe again.

    <p>Fancy hi-level interfaces often come with a high runtime overhead
making them slow. Here is an experiment with building such an
interface using constructions that PyPy should be good at
optimizing. The idea is to allow the JIT in PyPy to remove the
overhead introduced by using a fancy high-level python interface
on top of a low-level C interface. The application considered is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">Linear
programming</a>. It is a tool used to solve linear optimization
problems. It can for example be used to find the nonnegative values
x, y and z that gives the maximum value of

There exists general purpose solvers for these kind of problems that
are very fast and can literally handle millions of variables. To use
them however the problem has to be transformed into some specific
matrix form, and the coefficients of all the matrices
has to be passed to the solver using some API. This transformation is
a tedious and error prone step that forces you to work with matrix
indexes instead of readable variable names. Also it makes maintaining
an implementation hard since any modification has to be transformed
too.

<p></p>
The example above comes from the manual of
the <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glpk/">glpk</a> library. That
manual continues by describing how to convert this problem into the
standard form of glpk (which involves introducing three new variables)
and then gives the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hakanardo/pplp/src/825cdbc5cae6/blog/sample.c">c-code</a> needed to call the
library. Relating that c-code to the problem above without the
intermediate explanation of the manual is not easy. A common
solution here is to build a hi-level interface that allows a more
natural way of defining the matrices and/or allow the equations to be
entered symbolically. Unfortunately, such interfaces often become
slow. For the benchmark below for example, 
<a href="https://abel.ee.ucla.edu/cvxopt">cvxopt</a>
requires 20 minutes to setup a problem that takes 9.43 seconds to solve
(this seems a bit extreme, am I doing something wrong?).

<p></p>
The high-level interface I constructed on top of the
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glpk/">glpk</a> library is 
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/hakanardo/pplp">pplp</a> and it allows
the equations to be entered symbolically. The above problem can be
solved using
<pre>
    lp = LinearProgram()
    x, y, z = lp.IntVar(), lp.IntVar(), lp.IntVar()
    lp.objective = 10*x + 6*y + 4*z
    lp.add_constraint( x + y + z &lt;= 100 )
    lp.add_constraint( 10*x + 4*y + 5*z &lt;= 600 )
    lp.add_constraint( 2*x + 2*y + 6*z &lt;= 300 )
    lp.add_constraint( x &gt;= 0 )
    lp.add_constraint( y &gt;= 0 )
    lp.add_constraint( z &gt;= 0 )

    maxval = lp.maximize()
    print maxval
    print x.value, y.value, z.value
</pre>

<p></p>
To benchmark the API I used it to solve a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem">minimum-cost
  flow problem</a> with 154072 nodes and 390334 arcs. The C library
  needs 9.43 s to solve this and the pplp interface adds another 5.89
  s under PyPy and 28.17 s under CPython. A large amount of time is
  still spend setting up the problem, but it's a significant
  improvement over the 20 minutes required on CPython by
  <a href="https://abel.ee.ucla.edu/cvxopt">cvxopt</a>. It is
  probably not designed to be fast on this kind of benchmark. I have
  not been able to get cvxopt to work under PyPy. The benchmark used is
  available <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hakanardo/pplp/src/default/benchmark/">here</a>

          <p>Winston: It is indeed. What cvxopt spends 20 min on I don't know. One guess would be that it is passing the ~2 million coefficients involved to C one by one, possible with a bit of error checking for each of them. As for the 6 s used by pplp, it needs to convert the equations into the matrices glpk wants. That means shuffling the coefficients around a bit and some bookkeeping to keep track of which goes where.<br><br>Anonymous: OK, how would the above example look in that case?</p>

    <p>Hi everyone.  Since yesterday's blog post we got a ton of feedback, so we want
to clarify a few things, as well as share some of the progress we've made, in
only the 24 hours since the post.</p>
<h3>Reusing the original NumPy</h3>
<p>First, a lot of people have asked why we cannot just reuse the original NumPy
through <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>, our CPython C-API compatibility layer.  We believe this is
not the best approach, for a few reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> is slow, and always will be slow. It has to emulate far too many
details of the CPython object model that don't exist on PyPy (e.g.,
reference counting). Since people are using NumPy primarily for speed this
would mean that even if we could have a working NumPy, no one would want to
use it.  Also, as soon as the execution crosses the <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> boundary, it
becomes invisible to the JIT, which means the JIT has to assume the worst
and deoptimize stuff away.</li>
<li>NumPy uses many obscure documented and undocumented details of the CPython
C-API. Emulating these is often difficult or impossible (e.g. we can't fix
accessing a struct field, as there's no function call for us to intercept).</li>
<li>It's not much fun. Frankly, working on <tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt>, debugging the crashes,
and everything else that goes with it is not terribly fun, especially when
you know that the end result will be slow. We've demonstrated we can build
a much faster NumPy, in a way that's more fun, and given that the people
working on this are volunteers, it's important to keep us motivated.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we are <strong>not</strong> proposing to rewrite the entirety of NumPy or, god
forbid, BLAST, or any of the low level stuff that operates on C-level arrays,
only the parts that interface with Python code directly.</p>
<h3>C bindings vs. CPython C-API</h3>
<p>There are two issues on C code, one has a very nice story, and the other not so
much. First is the case of arbitrary C-code that isn't Python related, things
like <tt class="docutils literal">libsqlite</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">libbz2</tt>, or any random C shared library on your system.
PyPy will quite happily call into these, and bindings can be developed either
at the RPython level (using <tt class="docutils literal">rffi</tt>) or in pure Python, using <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt>.
Writing bindings with <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt> has the advantage that they can run on every
alternative Python implementation, such as Jython and IronPython.  Moreover,
once we merge the <tt class="docutils literal">jittypes2</tt> branch <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt> calls will even be smoking
fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is the CPython C-extension API. This is a very specific
API which CPython exposes, and PyPy tries to emulate. It will never be fast,
because there is far too much overhead in all the emulation that needs to be
done.</p>
<p>One of the reasons people write C extensions is for speed.  Often, with PyPy
you can just forget about C, write everything in pure python and let the JIT to
do its magic.</p>
<p>In case the PyPy JIT alone isn't fast enough, or you just want to
use existing C code then it might make sense to split
your C-extension into 2 parts, one which doesn't touch the CPython C-API and
thus can be loaded with <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt> and called from PyPy, and another which does
the interfacing with Python for CPython (where it will be faster).</p>
<p>There are also libraries written in C to interface with existing C codebases,
but for whom performance is not the largest goal, for these the right solution
is to try using CPyExt, and if it works that's great, but if it fails the
solution will be to rewrite using <cite>ctypes</cite>, where it will work on all Python
VMs, not just CPython.</p>
<p>And finally there are rare cases where rewriting in RPython makes more sense,
NumPy is one of the few examples of these because we need to be able to give
the JIT hints on how to appropriately vectorize all of the operations on an
array.  In general writing in RPython is not necessary for almost any
libraries, NumPy is something of a special case because it is so ubiquitous
that every ounce of speed is valuable, and makes the way people use it leads to
code structure where the JIT benefits enormously from extra hints and the
ability to manipulate memory directly, which is not possible from Python.</p>
<h3>Progress</h3>
<p>On a more positive note, after we published the <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2011/05/numpy-in-pypy-status-and-roadmap-8332894230779779992.html">last post</a>, several new people
came and contributed improvements to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">numpy-exp</span></tt> branch. We would like to
thank all of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>nightless_night contributed: An implementation of <tt class="docutils literal">__len__</tt>, fixed bounds
checks on <tt class="docutils literal">__getitem__</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">__setitem__</tt>.</li>
<li>brentp contributed: Subtraction and division on NumPy arrays.</li>
<li>MostAwesomeDude contributed: Multiplication on NumPy arrays.</li>
<li>hodgestar contributed: Binary operations between floats and NumPy arrays.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Those last two were technically an outstanding branch we finally merged, but
hopefully you get the picture. In addition there was some exciting work done by
regular PyPy contributors. I hope it's clear that there's a place to jump in
for people with any level of PyPy familiarity. If you're interested in
contributing please stop by #pypy on irc.freenode.net, the <a class="reference external" href="https://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">pypy-dev</a> mailing
list, or send us pull requests on <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy">bitbucket</a>.</p>

          <p>Isn't there another fairly major drawback to implementing in RPython - that you can only use it if it is compiled (translated) at the same time as pypy. So effectively pypy *has* to be distributed with all the RPython extensions you will ever use, or you have to retranslate *everything* whenever you add a new extension.<br><br>Developing cross-platform, cross-architecture, stuff with ctypes can also be a lot more painful than writing extensions using the Python C API (and having the compiler make some decisions at compile time rather than having to do it all at runtime).</p>

          <p>Most of python-dev's "antipathy" towards using ctypes is focused on using ctypes for stdlib modules, not on general principles. For security, stability, and portability reasons, many platforms need to disable ctypes when they build Python. Consequently, there is a policy that no stdlib module can use ctypes.

          <p>thanks for the follow-up. I won't argue with points 1 and 3, but I think 2 can be reasonably addressed: I don't think the usage of internal details is pervasive in the code, and most of it is for historical reasons. We cannot remove them altogether from the numpy headers for backward compatibility reasons, but we can replace most of it inside numpy itself.<br><br>I am still a bit confused though: from your description, it seems that you intend to fork numpy to replace some pieces from C to RPython, but if I look at the numpy-ext branch, I see a rewrite of numpy in rpython.

          <p>I think that the most important part of numpy is array operations (indexing, +-*/, broadcasting, etc). So it would be good enough to implement only array class in RPython and call to numpy using ctypes/cpyext for all other stuff. I've read somewhere about the plans to impose separation between numpy and scipy so numpy holds only implementation of fast arrays and scipy will hold all non-trivial operations on them. IMHO such separation will be ideal for pypy too.</p>

          <p>I like the idea of reimplementing part of Numpy in pypy to leverage the JIT in pypy. The existence of numexpr demonstrates the deficiency of Numpy as a Python library. A JIT is much more appropriate for what effectively should be a DSL.<br><br>But I would recommend something grander, perhaps for the longer term. I think if pypy could produce do for Python what McVM and McJIT propose to do for Matlab, it would be game-changing for Python and pypy. It would make pypy not only competitive with Matlab in ways that Numpy and Scipy are not yet and may never be, but also with F#. The rapid uptake of F# in financial industry in particular, despite the availability of Matlab, showcases the need for a fast prototyping language that does not rely on calling Fortran code for speed. I know I am looking for such language; Numpy and Python simply don't offer enough power and flexibility. I hope I can choose pypy.</p>

    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>NumPy integration is one of the single most requested features for PyPy. This
post tries to describe where we are, what we plan (or what we don't plan), and
how you can help.</p>
<p><strong>Short version for the impatient: we are doing experiments, which show that
PyPy+numpy can be faster and better than CPython+numpy.  We have a plan on how
to move forward, but at the moment there is lack of dedicated people or money
to tackle it.</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="the-longer-version">
<h3>The slightly longer version</h3>
<p>Integrating numpy in PyPy has been my pet project on an on-and-off (mostly off)
basis over the past two years. There were <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2009/07/pypy-numeric-experiments-2221073696038673235.html">some experiments</a>, then a long
pause, and then some more experiments which are documented below.</p>
<p>The general idea is <strong>not</strong> to use the existing CPython module, but to
reimplement numpy in RPython (i.e. the language PyPy is implemented in), thus
letting our JIT achieve extra speedups. The really cool thing about this part
is that numpy will automatically benefit of any general JIT improvements,
without any need of extra tweaking.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is branch called <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/numpy-exp/">numpy-exp</a> which contains a
translatable version of a very minimal version of numpy in the module called
<tt class="docutils literal">micronumpy</tt>. <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/numpy-exp/pypy/module/micronumpy/bench/">Example benchmarks</a> show the following:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="53%">
<col width="25%">
<col width="22%">
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>add</td>
<td>iterate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CPython 2.6.5 with numpy 1.3.0</td>
<td>0.260s (1x)</td>
<td>4.2 (1x)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PyPy numpy-exp @ 3a9d77b789e1</td>
<td>0.120s (2.2x)</td>
<td>0.087 (48x)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">add</tt> benchmark spends most of the time inside the <tt class="docutils literal">+</tt> operator on
arrays (doing <tt class="docutils literal">a + a + a + a + a</tt>), , which in CPython is implemented in C.
As you can see from the table above, the PyPy version is already ~2 times
faster. (Although <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/numexpr/">numexpr</a> is still faster than PyPy, but we're working on it).</p>
<p>The exact way array addition is implemented is worth another blog post, but in
short it lazily evaluates the expression and computes it at the end, avoiding
intermediate results. This approach scales much better than numexpr
and can lead to speeding up all the operations that you can perform on matrices.</p>
<p>The next obvious step to get even more speedups would be to extend the JIT to
use SSE operations on x86 CPUs, which should speed it up by about additional
2x, as well as using multiple threads to do operations.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">iterate</tt> is also interesting, but for entirely different reasons. On CPython
it spends most of the time inside a Python loop; the PyPy version is ~48 times
faster, because the JIT can optimize across the python/numpy boundary, showing
the potential of this approach, users are not grossly penalized for writing
their loops in Python.</p>
<p>The drawback of this approach is that we need to reimplement numpy in RPython,
which takes time.  A very rough estimate is that it would be possible to
implement an useful subset of it (for some definition of useful) in a period
of time comprised between one and three man-months.</p>
<p>It also seems that the result will be faster for most cases and the same speed
as original numpy for other cases. The only problem is finding the dedicated
persons willing to spend quite some time on this and however, I am willing to
both mentor such a person and encourage him or her.</p>
<p>The good starting point for helping would be to look at what's already
implemented in micronumpy modules and try extending it. Adding a <cite>-</cite> operator
or adding integers would be an interesting start. Drop by on #pypy on
irc.freenode.net or get in contact with developers via some other channel (such
as the pypy-dev mailing list) if you want to help.</p>
<p>Another option would be to sponsor NumPy development. In case you're
interested, please get in touch with us or leave your email in comments.</p>

          <p>@Nick the mixed approach (use cpyext and pieces in RPython) sounds maybe valuable short term, but it can burn people easily. RPython-only is way more elegant and gives you wins upfront. Since there is noone willing to invest time in short term approach, this sounds like a no-brainer.<br><br>@matt almost nothing should be implemented in RPython, except the interpreter itself. Writing Python should be fast enough. Numpy is a notable example where we want to leverage last bits and pieces of JIT and be really really fast. For example you can't really leverage SSE from Python layer.</p>

          <p>Are you in touch with Numpy developers? Are they eager to "stop" using Python and move to RPython? I mean, if this work needs to be redone for each version of Numpy, we will be always lagging behind, and always spend lot of efforts. On the other hand, if Numpy devs will start using the RPython for and let die the pure-Python one, then, the porting effort would me much more meaningful, and I believe it will be easier to find a group of people interested in doing it (myself, maybe)</p>

          <p>@Davide it's not Python vs RPython, it's C (which numpy is implemented in) vs RPython. No numpy users will be requires to use RPython for anything.<br><br>@Gary I believe you're wrong. The idea stays the same - you can call arbitrary C code that will manipulate raw memory and do what it wants to do. The idea is to implement only the interface part (which uses CPython C API) and not the C part, which will work anyway. So at the end, we hope to leverage that effort. Also we're not microsoft and we can't pay large sums of money to do it and having small subset of numpy that's really fast appeals much more to me than a large effort that only gives numpy for pypy (that's not faster than cpython's one).</p>

          <p>OK. As I've argued before in various pypy groups, I think one of the groups that will most strongly benefit from pypy's speed is the scientific community -- but they need numpy and scipy. So now that I know that this plan will (hopefully) allow for both of those to be used from pypy, I'm encouraged by it.</p>

          <p>You say you lack sufficient resources to put in a large effort, but your answers to CPython extensions is "reimplement everything RPython".

          <p>@Joseph cpyext will always be only a semi-permanent compatibility layer. Making numpy work with cpyext is both unrewarding (hard work with obscure bugs), but also significantly harder to make fast, in some places completely impossible. Yes, it doesn't make sense for all extensions, it doesn't even make sense for most. Numpy is however special, since speed is the reason of it's existence. Also, frankly, when it comes down to my free time "let's make this cool JITed code run 50x faster than CPython" beats "let's stare puzzled at this segfault".</p>

          <p>To everybody asking why we cannot just use cpyext: I already tried it. It's not gonna happen without hacking the crap out of numpy. Additionally, it's going to be slow: Numpy is not fast for most operations, because of double-unboxing. Only vector ops are fast. JITing the operations is going to be a big win.<br><br>For those of you not believing numpy is slow, look at numexpr (https://code.google.com/p/numexpr/) which implements many of the same ideas that we are planning on implementing.</p>

          <p>Hi maciej, I am david (we quickly met at pycon where I presented myself as a numpy guy).<br><br>I think part of the misunderstanding is around the meaning of "numpy in pypy". Rewriting an array class on top of pypy is certainly valuable, and I am in no position to tell other people what to do in their free time. But I don't think it can realistically mean people will be able to use this instead of numpy after 2-3 man months: how will interfacing with BLAS/LAPACK work ? How will interfacing with the vast amount of fortran code in scipy work ?<br><br>If cpyext is indeed a dead-end, it would valuable to know why. Personally, I would certainly be happy to fix parts of numpy that makes cpyext impractically, even if it meant it were twice slower than on cpython. Because I could still benefit from pypy *elsewhere*, without having to rewrite all the numpy/scipy/etc... code.</p>

          <p>Maciej, let me second Nick's polite request for a more detailed post about the plan.<br><br>If even David, an actual numpy developer can misunderstand your description, what do you expect from the unwashed masses of scipy users like me? :) Fortunately it does not take too much effort to alleviate the worries.

          <p>@daniel: I don't think there is a misunderstanding as much as a different people wanting different things. I believe that Maciej and other pypy people are more interested in leveraging pypy and its JIT do to things which are indeed quite complicated in numpy today (avoid temporary, fast  iterators in python, etc...). I have little doubt that pypy is a better platform than cpython to experiment this kind of things.<br><br>I am more surprised about the claim that numpy is so tight to cpyhon internals. It certainly depends on the C API, but mostly public API, documented as such.</p>

          <p>Well, if the answer of "How to make numpy available in pypy" is "do a complicated rewrite of numpy," then I'm pretty skeptical about the pypy project. I primarily use numpy, but also scipy sometimes and Image sometimes. As a user it's most important to me that code runs. Speed is not as critical. For example if I take stddev() of an array I first want that to run, and only secondarily want it efficient. If there's a library that I might want to use, and I can't expend a reasonable amount of effort to wrap it, or else someone else can do that, then I don't find pypy that encouraging at all. Since there are lots of libraries out there, and it has been convincingly argued that Python's primary utility is its library support.</p>

          <p>@Anonymous: While you may not be concerned with performance, a great many people are.  The only way to have arbitrary numpy stuff work in theory would be CPyExt, but as we've said that's frought with complications in that a) it won't work out of the box on something that uses as many corners of the CPython C-API as NumPy, and b) will always be slow.  Given people's desire for speed with respect to NumPy we consider reimplementing it a reasonable course.</p>

          <p>Alex -- I'm not saying speed is unimportant. What I'm saying is being able to easily make existing CPython extension modules compile against numpy is very important to people. If there is a 20% slowdown or a 10% speedup of the C extension in many cases that is no big deal. Most importantly it would put PyPy on rather equal standing with CPython. And then the JIT pure Python code might win out for efficiency, so PyPy might be a net win for many users.<br><br>On the other hand doing research into lazy evaluation and vectorizing and loop restructuring, can obviously make numpy faster, but is more of a tangent, than being helpful to the majority of users who just want to run their CPython extensions at roughly the same speed under PyPy. Until people can actually run their extensions easily (which I argue is the major value that Python has) I doubt there will be much adoption of PyPy.<br><br>Say I can already add lists of floats and take their standard deviation using numpy, using the C extension library. It isn't clear to me why this should be substantially less efficient under PyPy than under CPython.<br><br>We see the same issue with Python 3.0 adoption. Personally I think it makes bad language changes such as getting rid of string % operator which I use constantly, so I'd avoid it for that reason. But far more importantly it can't run a lot of the libraries I use, with comparable performance. So it's completely a no go to me for that reason.<br><br>So I am suggesting that optimizing a single library by rewriting it, seems a case of premature optimization when most libraries can't even run with PyPy.</p>

          <p>Maciej -- I didn't realize large parts of these libraries could be reused. So maybe once the PyPy C extension facilities are working well enough that important 3rd party libraries can be compiled, I'll just switch to PyPy for performance. It sure does sound more fun to make numpy functions compile down to heavily optimized RPython and get big speed gains. But I still maintain that users would appreciate being able to get all arbitrary libraries to build in the first place, e.g. if scipy or library X depends on the numpy C interface, and that gets broken in the PyPy numpy implementation, then users won't be able to use their desired library at all. So I guess I'm just arguing that the most C extension modules that can work with numpy, the better. Since if we wanted fast but no libraries we'd be using C :-).</p>

          <p>Maciej (et all),<br>it looks like this issue isn't clear yet to people. Let's see if I can help.<br><br>Numpy is made of 3 "piece" (doesn't matter if they are separate pieces or mingled together, they are there): a pure python part, a pure C part and a C-to-python "glue". All of them are very important to numpy, but the C-to-python glue is special, in that both python and C need to access the same data structures without any conversion or copy (otherwise it will be slow). I'm not sure what exactly numpy is doing for this "special glue" part, but that's the point where pypy suffer: of course pypy works just fine with pure python, and doesn't "care" at all about the C sections. So one option is to rewrite the C-to-python pieces of numpy. I'm sorry but it's still unclear to me if you want also to rewrite the C part or not (here you said kind-of-yes: https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/05/numpy-in-pypy-status-and-roadmap.html?showComment=1304533136864#c3499269873134208179 and here you said no: https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/05/numpy-in-pypy-status-and-roadmap.html?showComment=1308734098907#c2151221303214453177 so probably you should clarify better)<br><br>Now, if I understand it right, your plan is to fork numpy for this purpose (either rewrite the C-to-python glue only, or the C part also). I believe this will fail, and the reason is pretty simple: first, even before you start, you already say that you don't have people/money/time to commit to this project. Second, maintaining a fork is a huge, huge task. You might easily introduce bugs, break feature, etc - while people are expecting something that "just works" as drop-in replacement, so even a "almost success" from a technical point of view, can be a big failure for adopter, if it doesn't behave. Last, but not least, numpy is a moving target, and you'll always play catch up. Is this the game you want to play??<br><br>Now, I don't want to tell you what you have to do for fun, but if you want to have chances of success, you have to change the "politics" of your plan. I trust you that technically your plan is fine, but rather than implementing it within a numpy fork (or worst: rewrite), I suggest that you work with the numpy and/or CPython community, to see if you can write a wrapper around cpyext (or whatever they are using for C-to-Python glue). This wrapper (at compiler time) should either become cpyext (or whatever) if you are using CPython, or become "something else" if you are using pypy. If you persuade numpy people to use this wrapper you'll have the same numpy code base working as is in CPython and pypy. Sure you will not be exploiting the faster-than-C capabilities of pypy, but you can get there more smoothly: improving the speed one feature at time, while the rest of the framework is still working and thus useful, and thus increasing its user base, people interested in it (and some of them may become contributors).<br><br>Instead your plan sounds like:  implement one feature at time, while the rest of the framework doesn't work and thus nobody uses it in production, let alone care about its speed. On top of which, you'll be trying to catch-up with numpy.</p>

    <p>We're pleased to announce the 1.5 release of PyPy. This release updates
PyPy with the features of CPython 2.7.1, including the standard library. Thus
all the features of <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.6.html">CPython 2.6</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.7.html">CPython 2.7</a> are now supported. It
also contains additional performance improvements. You can download it here:</p>

</blockquote>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h2>What is PyPy?</h2>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7.1. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://bit.ly/mbVWwJ">pypy 1.5 and cpython 2.6.2</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>This release includes the features of CPython 2.6 and 2.7. It also includes a
large number of small improvements to the tracing JIT compiler. It supports
Intel machines running Linux 32/64 or Mac OS X.  Windows is beta (it roughly
works but a lot of small issues have not been fixed so far).  Windows 64 is
not yet supported.</p>
<p>Numerous speed achievements are described on <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com">our blog</a>. Normalized speed
charts comparing <a class="reference external" href="https://bit.ly/joPhHo">pypy 1.5 and pypy 1.4</a> as well as <a class="reference external" href="https://bit.ly/mbVWwJ">pypy 1.5 and cpython
2.6.2</a> are available on our benchmark website. The speed improvement over 1.4
seems to be around 25% on average.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-highlights">
<h2>More highlights</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The largest change in PyPy's tracing JIT is adding support for <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2011/01/loop-invariant-code-motion-1998392217676829154.html">loop invariant
code motion</a>, which was mostly done by Håkan Ardö. This feature improves the
performance of tight loops doing numerical calculations.</li>
<li>The CPython extension module API has been improved and now supports many more
extensions. For information on which one are supported, please refer to our
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/Home">compatibility wiki</a>.</li>
<li>These changes make it possible to support <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2011/04/using-tkinter-and-idle-with-pypy-6156563216925585965.html">Tkinter and IDLE</a>.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/library/profile.html">cProfile</a> profiler is now working with the JIT. However, it skews the
performance in unstudied ways. Therefore it is not yet usable to analyze
subtle performance problems (the same is true for CPython of course).</li>
<li>There is an <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/alex_gaynor/pypy-postgresql">external fork</a> which includes an RPython version of the
<tt class="docutils literal">postgresql</tt>.  However, there are no prebuilt binaries for this.</li>
<li>Our developer documentation was moved to Sphinx and cleaned up.</li>
<li>and many small things :-)</li>
</ul>
