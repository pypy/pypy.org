<h3>RevPDB</h3>
<p>A "reverse debugger" is a debugger where you can go forward and
backward in time.  It is an uncommon feature, at least in the open
source world, but I have no idea why.  I have used <a class="reference external" href="https://undo.io/">undodb-gdb</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://rr-project.org/">rr</a>, which are reverse debuggers for C code, and I can only say that
they saved me many, many days of poking around blindly in gdb.</p>
<p>The PyPy team is pleased to give you "RevPDB", a reverse-debugger
similar to <tt class="docutils literal">rr</tt> but for Python.</p>
<p>An example is worth a thousand words.  Let's say your big Python
program has a bug that shows up inconsistently.  You have nailed it
down to something like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>start <tt class="docutils literal">x.py</tt>, which does stuff (maybe involving processing files,
answering some web requests that you simulate from another terminal,
etc.);</li>
<li>sometimes, after a few minutes, your program's state becomes
inconsistent and you get a failing assert or another exception.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the case where RevPDB is useful.</p>
<p>RevPDB is available only on 64-bit Linux and OS/X right now, but should
not be too hard to port to other OSes.  It is very much <em>alpha-level!</em>
(It is a debugger full of bugs.  Sorry about that.)  I believe it is
still useful---it helped me in one <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/bd220c268bc9">real use case</a> already.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-get-revpdb">
<h3>How to get RevPDB</h3>
<p>The following demo was done with an alpha version for 64-bit Linux,
compiled for Arch Linux.  I won't provide the binary; it should be
easy enough to retranslate (much faster than a regular PyPy because it
contains neither a JIT nor a custom GC).  Grab the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/download.html#building-from-source">PyPy sources</a> from
Mercurial, and then:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
hg update reverse-debugger
# or "hg update ff376ccacb36" for exactly this demo
cd pypy/goal
../../rpython/bin/rpython -O2 --revdb targetpypystandalone.py  \
                  --withoutmod-cpyext --withoutmod-micronumpy
</pre>
<p>and possibly rename the final <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-c</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> to avoid
confusion.</p>
<p>Other platforms than 64-bit Linux and OS/X need some fixes before they work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="demo">
<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>For this demo, we're going to use this <tt class="docutils literal">x.py</tt> as the "big program":</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import os

class Foo(object):
    value = 5

lst1 = [Foo() for i in range(100)]
lst1[50].value += 1
for x in lst1:
    x.value += 1

for x in lst1:
    if x.value != 6:
        print 'oops!'
        os._exit(1)
</pre>
<p>Of course, it is clear what occurs in this small example: the check
fails on item 50.  For this demo, the check has been written with
<tt class="docutils literal">os._exit(1)</tt>, because this exits immediately the program.  If it
was written with an <tt class="docutils literal">assert</tt>, then its failure would execute things
in the <tt class="docutils literal">traceback</tt> module afterwards, to print the traceback; it
would be a minor mess just to find the exact point of the failing
<tt class="docutils literal">assert</tt>.  (This and other issues are supposed to be fixed in the
future, but for now it is alpha-level.)</p>
<p>Anyway, with a regular <tt class="docutils literal">assert</tt> and a regular post-mortem <tt class="docutils literal">pdb</tt>,
we could observe that <tt class="docutils literal">x.value</tt> is indeed 7 instead of 6 when the
assert fails.  Imagine that the program is much bigger: how would we
find the exact chain of events that caused this value 7 to show up on
this particular <tt class="docutils literal">Foo</tt> object?  This is what RevPDB is for.</p>
<p><strike>First, we need for now to disable Address Space Layout Randomization
(ASLR), otherwise replaying will not work.  This is done once with the
following command line, which changes the state until the next
reboot:</strike></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
</pre>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> the above is no longer necessary from revision ff376ccacb36.</p>
<p>Run <tt class="docutils literal">x.py</tt> with RevPDB's version of PyPy instead of the regular
interpreter (CPython or PyPy):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
PYPYRDB=log.rdb ./pypy-revdb x.py
</pre>
<p>This <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> executable is like a slow PyPy executable, running
(for now) without a JIT.  This produces a file <tt class="docutils literal">log.rdb</tt> which
contains a complete log of this execution.  (If the bug we are
tracking occurs rarely, we need to re-run it several times until we
get the failure.  But once we got the failure, then we're done with
this step.)</p>
<p>Start:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rpython/translator/revdb/revdb.py log.rdb
</pre>
<p>We get a pdb-style debugger.  This <tt class="docutils literal">revdb.py</tt> is a normal Python
program, which you run with an unmodified Python; internally, it looks
inside the log for the path to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> and run it as needed (as
one forking subprocess, in a special mode).</p>
<p>Initially, we are at the start of the program---not at the end, like
we'd get in a regular debugger:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
File "&lt;builtin&gt;/app_main.py", line 787 in setup_bootstrap_path:
(1)$
</pre>
<p>The list of commands is available with <tt class="docutils literal">help</tt>.</p>
<p>Go to the end with <tt class="docutils literal">continue</tt> (or <tt class="docutils literal">c</tt>):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(1)$ continue
File "/tmp/x.py", line 14 in &lt;module&gt;:
...
  lst1 = [Foo() for i in range(100)]
  lst1[50].value += 1
  for x in lst1:
      x.value += 1

  for x in lst1:
      if x.value != 6:
          print 'oops!'
&gt;         os._exit(1)
(19727)$
</pre>
<p>We are now at the beginning of the last executed line.  The number
19727 is the "time", measured in number of lines executed.  We can go
backward with the <tt class="docutils literal">bstep</tt> command (backward step, or <tt class="docutils literal">bs</tt>), line
by line, and forward again with the <tt class="docutils literal">step</tt> command.  There are also
commands <tt class="docutils literal">bnext</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">bcontinue</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">bfinish</tt> and their forward
equivalents.  There is also "<tt class="docutils literal">go TIME</tt>" to jump directly to the specified
time.  (Right now the debugger only stops at "line start"
events, not at function entry or exit, which makes some cases a bit
surprising: for example, a <tt class="docutils literal">step</tt> from the return statement of
function <tt class="docutils literal">foo()</tt> will jump directly to the caller's caller, if the
caller's current line was <tt class="docutils literal">return foo() + 2</tt>, because no "line
start" event occurs in the caller after <tt class="docutils literal">foo()</tt> returns to it.)</p>
<p>We can print Python expressions and statements using the <tt class="docutils literal">p</tt>
command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(19727)$ p x
$0 = &lt;__main__.Foo object at 0xfffffffffffeab3e&gt;
(19727)$ p x.value
$1 = 7
(19727)$ p x.value + 1
8
</pre>
<p>The "<tt class="docutils literal">$NUM =</tt>" prefix is only shown when we print an object that
really exists in the debugged program; that's why the last line does
not contain it.  Once a <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM</tt> has been printed, then we can use
it in further expressions---even at a different point time.  It
becomes an anchor that always refers to the same object:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(19727)$ bstep

File "/tmp/x.py", line 13 in &lt;module&gt;:
...

  lst1 = [Foo() for i in range(100)]
  lst1[50].value += 1
  for x in lst1:
      x.value += 1

  for x in lst1:
      if x.value != 6:
&gt;         print 'oops!'
          os._exit(1)
(19726)$ p $0.value
$1 = 7
</pre>
<p>In this case, we want to know when this value 7 was put in this
attribute.  This is the job of a watchpoint:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(19726)$ watch $0.value
Watchpoint 1 added
updating watchpoint value: $0.value =&gt; 7
</pre>
<p>This watchpoint means that <tt class="docutils literal">$0.value</tt> will be evaluated at each line.
When the <tt class="docutils literal">repr()</tt> of this expression changes, the watchpoint activates
and execution stops:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(19726)$ bcontinue
[searching 19629..19726]
[searching 19338..19629]

updating watchpoint value: $0.value =&gt; 6
Reverse-hit watchpoint 1: $0.value
File "/tmp/x.py", line 9 in &lt;module&gt;:
  import os

  class Foo(object):
      value = 5

  lst1 = [Foo() for i in range(100)]
  lst1[50].value += 1
  for x in lst1:
&gt;     x.value += 1

  for x in lst1:
      if x.value != 6:
          print 'oops!'
          os._exit(1)
(19524)$
</pre>
<p>Note that using the <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM</tt> syntax is essential in watchpoints.  You
can't say "<tt class="docutils literal">watch x.value</tt>", because the variable <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> will go out
of scope very soon when we move forward or backward in time.  In fact
the watchpoint expression is always evaluated inside an environment
that contains the builtins but not the current locals and globals.
But it also contains all the <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM</tt>, which can be used to refer to
known objects.  It is thus common to watch <tt class="docutils literal">$0.attribute</tt> if <tt class="docutils literal">$0</tt>
is an object, or to watch <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">len($1)</span></tt> if <tt class="docutils literal">$1</tt> is some list.  The
watch expression can also be a simple boolean: for example, "<tt class="docutils literal">watch
$2 in $3</tt>" where <tt class="docutils literal">$3</tt> is some dict and <tt class="docutils literal">$2</tt> is some object that
you find now in the dict; you would use this to find out the time when
<tt class="docutils literal">$2</tt> was put inside <tt class="docutils literal">$3</tt>, or removed from it.</p>
<p>Use "<tt class="docutils literal">info watchpoints</tt>" and "<tt class="docutils literal">delete &lt;watchpointnum&gt;</tt>" to manage
watchpoints.</p>
<p>There are also regular breakpoints, which you set with "<tt class="docutils literal">b
FUNCNAME</tt>".  It breaks whenever there is a call to a function that
happens to have the given name.  (It might be annoying to use for a
function like <tt class="docutils literal">__init__()</tt> which has many homonyms.  There is no
support for breaking on a fully-qualified name or at a given line
number for now.)</p>
<p>In our demo, we stop at the line <tt class="docutils literal">x.value += 1</tt>, which is where the
value was changed from 6 to 7.  Use <tt class="docutils literal">bcontinue</tt> again to stop at the
line <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lst1[50].value</span> += 1</tt>, which is where the value was changed from
5 to 6.  Now we know how this <tt class="docutils literal">value</tt> attribute ends up being 7.</p>

<p>In big programs, the workflow is similar, just more complex.  Usually
it works this way: we find interesting points in time with some
combination of watchpoints and some direct commands to move around.
We write down on a piece of (real or virtual) paper these points in
history, including most importantly their time, so that we can
construct an ordered understanding of what is going on.</p>
<p>The current <tt class="docutils literal">revdb</tt> can be annoying and sometimes even crash; but
the history you reconstruct can be kept.  All the times and
expressions printed are still valid when you restart <tt class="docutils literal">revdb</tt>.  The
only thing "lost" is the <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM</tt> objects, which you need to print
again.  (Maybe instead of <tt class="docutils literal">$0</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">$1</tt>, ...  we should use <tt class="docutils literal">$&lt;big
number&gt;</tt>, where the big number identifies uniquely the object by its
creation time.  These numbers would continue to be valid even after
<tt class="docutils literal">revdb</tt> is restarted.  They are more annoying to use than just
<tt class="docutils literal">$0</tt> though.)</p>
<p><b>Screencast:</b> Here's a (slightly typo-y) screencast of cfbolz using the reverse debugger:
</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="current-issues">
<h3>Current issues</h3>
<p>General issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you are using <tt class="docutils literal">revdb</tt> on a log that took more than a few
minutes to record, then it can be painfully slow.  This is because
<tt class="docutils literal">revdb</tt> needs to replay again big parts of the log for some
operations.</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> is currently missing the following modules:<ul>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">thread</tt> (implementing multithreading is possible, but not done
yet);</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">cpyext</tt> (the CPython C API compatibility layer);</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">micronumpy</tt> (minor issue only);</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">_continuation</tt> (for greenlets).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does not contain a JIT, and does not use our fast garbage
collectors.  You can expect <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> to be maybe 3 times
slower than CPython.</li>
<li>Only works on Linux and OS/X.  There is no fundamental reason for
this restriction, but it is some work to fix.</li>
<li>Replaying a program uses a <em>lot</em> more memory; maybe 15x as much than
during the recording.  This is because it creates many forks.  If
you have a program that consumes 10% of your RAM or more, you will
need to reduce <tt class="docutils literal">MAX_SUBPROCESSES</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">process.py</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Replaying also comes with a bunch of user interface issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">Attempted to do I/O or access raw memory</tt>: we get this whenever
trying to <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> some expression that cannot be evaluated with
only the GC memory---or which can, but then the <tt class="docutils literal">__repr__()</tt>
method of the result cannot.  We need to reset the state with
<tt class="docutils literal">bstep</tt> + <tt class="docutils literal">step</tt> before we can print anything else.  However,
if only the <tt class="docutils literal">__repr__()</tt> crashes, you still see the <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM =</tt>
prefix, and you can use that <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM</tt> afterwards.</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">id()</tt> is globally unique, returning a reproducible 64-bit number,
so sometimes using <tt class="docutils literal">id(x)</tt> is a workaround for when using <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>
doesn't work because of <tt class="docutils literal">Attempted to do I/O</tt> issues (e.g.  <tt class="docutils literal">p
[id(x) for x in somelist]</tt>).</li>
<li>as explained in the demo, next/bnext/finish/bfinish might jump
around a bit non-predictably.</li>
<li>similarly, breaks on watchpoints can stop at apparently unexpected
places (when going backward, try to do "step" once).  The issue is
that it can only stop at the beginning of every line.  In the
extreme example, if a line is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo(somelist.pop(getindex()))</span></tt>,
then <tt class="docutils literal">somelist</tt> is modified in the middle.  Immediately before
this modification occurs, we are in <tt class="docutils literal">getindex()</tt>, and
immediately afterwards we are in <tt class="docutils literal">foo()</tt>.  The watchpoint will
stop the program at the end of <tt class="docutils literal">getindex()</tt> if running backward,
and at the start of <tt class="docutils literal">foo()</tt> if running forward, but never
actually on the line doing the change.</li>
<li>watchpoint expressions <em>must not</em> have any side-effect at all.  If
they do, the replaying will get out of sync and <tt class="docutils literal">revdb.py</tt> will
complain about that.  Regular <tt class="docutils literal">p</tt> expressions and statements can
have side-effects; these effects are discarded as soon as you move
in time again.</li>
<li>sometimes even "<tt class="docutils literal">p import foo</tt>" will fail with <tt class="docutils literal">Attempted to do
I/O</tt>.  Use instead "<tt class="docutils literal">p import sys; foo = <span class="pre">sys.modules['foo']</span></tt>".</li>
<li>use <tt class="docutils literal">help</tt> to see all commands.  <tt class="docutils literal">backtrace</tt> can be useful.
There is no <tt class="docutils literal">up</tt> command; you have to move in time instead,
e.g. using <tt class="docutils literal">bfinish</tt> to go back to the point where the current
function was called.</li>

<div class="section" id="how-revpdb-is-done">
<h3>How RevPDB is done</h3>
<p>If I had to pick the main advantage of PyPy over CPython, it is that
we have got with the RPython translation toolchain a real place for
experimentation.  Every now and then, we build inside RPython some
feature that gives us an optionally tweaked version of the PyPy
interpreter---tweaked in a way that would be hard to do with CPython,
because it would require systematic changes everywhere.  The most
obvious and successful examples are the GC and the JIT.  But there
have been many other experiments along the same lines, from the
so-called <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/extradoc/-/blob/branch/default/tip/eu-report/D07.1_Massive_Parallelism_and_Translation_Aspects-2007-02-28.pdf">stackless transformation</a> in the early days, to the STM
version of PyPy.</p>
<p>RevPDB works in a similar way.  It is a version of PyPy in which some
operations are systematically replaced with other operations.</p>
<p>To keep the log file at a reasonable size, we duplicate the content of
all GC objects during replaying---by repeating the same actions on
them, without writing anything in the log file.  So that means that in
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> binary, the operations that do arithmetic or
read/write GC-managed memory are not modified.  Most operations are
like that.  However, the other operations, the ones that involve
either non-GC memory or calls to external C functions, are tweaked.
Each of these operations is replaced with code that works in two
modes, based on a global flag:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>in "recording" mode, we log the result of the operation (but not the
arguments);</li>
<li>in "replaying" mode, we don't really do the operation at all, but
instead just fetch the result from the log.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, all remaining unmodified operations (arithmetic and GC
load/store) are completely deterministic.  So during replaying, every
integer or non-GC pointer variable will have exactly the same value as
it had during recording.  Interestingly, it means that if the
recording process had a big array in non-GC memory, then in the
replaying process, the array is not allocated at all; it is just
represented by the same address, but there is nothing there.  When we
record "read item 123 from the array", we record the result of the
read (but not the "123").  When we replay, we're seeing again the same
"read item 123 from the array" operation.  At that point, we don't
read anything; we just return the result from the log.  Similarly,
when recording a "write" to the array, we record nothing (this write
operation has no result); so that when replaying, we redo nothing.</p>
<p>Note how that differs from anything managed by GC memory: GC objects
(including GC arrays) are really allocated, writes really occur, and
reads are redone.  We don't touch the log in this case.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-reverse-debuggers-for-python">
<h3>Other reverse debuggers for Python</h3>
<p>There are already some Python experiments about <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger#Reverse_debugging">reverse debugging</a>.
This is also known as "omniscient debugging".  However, I claim that
the result they get to is not very useful (for the purpose presented
here).  How they work is typically by recording changes to some
objects, like lists and dictionaries, in addition to recording the
history of where your program passed through.  However, the problem of
Python is that lists and dictionaries are not the end of the story.
There are many, many, many types of objects written in C which are
mutable---in fact, the immutable ones are the exception.  You can try
to systematically record all changes, but it is a huge task and easy
to forget a detail.</p>
<p>In other words it is a typical use case for tweaking the RPython
translation toolchain, rather than tweaking the CPython (or PyPy)
interpreter directly.  The result that we get here with RevPDB is more
similar to <a class="reference external" href="https://rr-project.org/">rr</a> anyway, in that only a relatively small number of
external events are recorded---not every single change to every single
list and dictionary.</p>

<div class="section" id="future-work">
<h3>Future work</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, it is alpha-level, and only works on Linux and OS/X.
So the plans for the immediate future are to fix the various
issues described above, and port to more operating systems.  The core of the system
is in the C file and headers in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rpython/translator/revdb/src-revdb</span></tt>.</p>
<p>For interested people, there is also the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/duhton/">Duhton</a> interpreter and its
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reverse-debugger</span></tt> branch, which is where I prototyped the RPython
concept before moving to PyPy.  The basics should work for any
interpreter written in RPython, but they require some specific code to
interface with the language; in the case of PyPy, it is in
<tt class="docutils literal">pypy/interpreter/reverse_debugging.py</tt>.</p>
<p>In parallel, there are various user interface improvements that people
could be interested in, like a more "pdb++" experience.  (And the script
at <tt class="docutils literal">rpython/translator/revdb/revdb.py</tt> should be moved out into some
more "official" place, and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reverse-debugger</span></tt> branch should be
merged back to default.)</p>
<p>I would certainly welcome any help!</p>

We have released PyPy2.7 v5.3, about six weeks after PyPy 5.1 and a week after
<a class="reference external" href="../posts/2016/05/pypy33-v52-alpha-1-released-1725927506363370346.html">PyPy3.3 v5.2 alpha 1</a>, the first PyPy release targeting 3.3
compatibility. This new PyPy2.7 release includes major improvements for the
C-API compatibility layer. In addition to complete support
for <b>lxml</b>, we now pass most (more than 95%) of the upstream <b>numpy</b> test suite. We can build and run <b>scipy</b> and <b>matplotlib</b> as well. Most of the failures have to do with (ab) use of the C-API, for instance writing to a read-only pointer obtained from <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">PyString_AsString()</span>.<br><br>
Note that the C-API compatibility layer is significantly slower than CPython, as explained in the <a href="../posts/2016/02/c-api-support-update-8582726091670983181.html">blog post</a> about the new strategy for reflection of C objects into the PyPy interpreter.<br><br>
We updated <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org/">cffi</a> to version 1.7 (incremental changes which provide a nicer developer experience, documented <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatsnew.html">here</a>). We would encourage developers to move their C-extension modules to cffi, but are willing to help you work through issues with existing code; come to #pypy on IRC and let us know how we can help you help us do better.<br><br>

We would like to thank our donors for their continued support of the PyPy
project. We would also like to thank our contributors and
encourage new people to join the project. PyPy has many
layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation

What is PyPy?</h1>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7</a> performance comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br><br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://pypyjs.org/">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython can do for them.<br><br>
This release supports:<br><ul class="simple">
<li>
<b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems (Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, Windows 32, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>newer <b>ARM</b> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <b>PPC64</b> running Linux</li>
<li>
<b>s390x</b> running Linux</li>

<h1>What is PyPy?</h1>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for<br>
CPython 2.7.10 and one day 3.3.5. It's fast due to its integrated tracing JIT<br>
compiler.</p>
<p>We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://pypyjs.org">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython<br>
can do for them.</p>
<p>This release supports:</p>
<blockquote><ul class="simple">
<li>
<strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems except Windows<br>
(Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, OpenBSD, FreeBSD),</li>
<li>newer <strong>ARM</strong> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux,</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <strong>PPC64</strong> running Linux,</li>
<li>
<strong>s390x</strong> running Linux</li>
</ul></blockquote>

We have released a bugfix for PyPy 5.1, due to a <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/2282">regression</a> in installing third-party packages depending on numpy (using our numpy fork available at https://bitbucket.org/pypy/numpy ).<br><br>Thanks to those who reported the issue. We also fixed a regression in translating PyPy which increased the memory required to translate. Improvement will be noticed by downstream packagers and those who translate rather than<br>download pre-built binaries.<br>

We have released PyPy 5.1, about a month after PyPy 5.0.<br><br>
This release includes more improvement to warmup time and memory requirements, extending the work done on PyPy 5.0. We have seen an additional reduction of about 20% in memory requirements, and up to 30% warmup time improvement, more detail in the <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2016/04/warmup-improvements-more-efficient-7082900097299909512.html">blog post</a>.<br><br>
We also now have <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2016/04/pypy-enterprise-edition-3688275697656890948.html">full support for the IBM s390x</a>. Since this support is in <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a>, any dynamic language written using RPython, like PyPy, will automagically be supported on that architecture.<br><br>
We updated <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org/">cffi</a> to 1.6 (cffi 1.6 itself will be released shortly), and continue to improve support for the wider python ecosystem using the PyPy interpreter.<br><br>

    <p>With the latest additions, PyPy's JIT now supports the Z architecture on Linux. The newest architecture revision (also known as s390x, or colloquially referred to as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_iron" title="Big iron">big iron</a>") is the 64-bit extension for IBM mainframes. Currently only Linux 64 bit is supported (not z/OS nor TPF).<br>
This is the fourth assembler backend supported by PyPy in addition to x86 (32 and 64), ARM (32-bit only) and PPC64 (both little- and big-endian). It might seem that we kind of get a hang of new architectures. Thanks to IBM for funding this work!<br><br></p>
<h2>
<span style="font-size: large;">History</span> </h2>
When I went to university one lecture covered the prediction of Thomas Watson in 1943. His famous quote "I think there is a world market for maybe five computers ...", turned out not to be true. <br><br>
However, even 70 years later, mainframes are used more often than you think. They back critical tasks requiring a high level of stability/security and offer high hardware and computational utilization rates by virtualization.<br><br>
With the new PyPy JIT backend we are happy to present a fast Python virtual machine for mainframes and contribute more free software running on s390x.<br><br><h2>
<span style="font-size: large;">Meta tracing</span>
</h2>
Even though the JIT backend has been tested on PyPy, it is not restricted to  the Python programming language. Do you have a great idea for a DSL, or another language that should run on mainframes? Go ahead and just implement your interpreter using RPython.<br><br><h2>
<span style="font-size: large;">How do I get a copy?</span>
</h2>
PyPy can be built using the usual instructions found <a href="https://pypy.org/download.html#building-from-source" target="_blank">here</a>. As soon as the next PyPy version has been released we will provide binaries. Until then you can just grab a nightly <a href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/" target="_blank">here</a>.We are currently busy to get the next version of PyPy ready, so an official release will be rolled out soon.<br><br><h2>
<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Comparing s390x to x86</b></span>
</h2>
The goal of this comparison is not to scientifically evaluate the benefits/disadvantages on s390x, but rather to see that PyPy's architecture delivers the same benefits as it does on other platforms. Similar to the comparison done for PPC I ran the benchmarks using the same setup.

<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to inform that we've finished another round of
improvements to the warmup performance of PyPy. Before I go
into details, I'll recap the achievements that we've done since we've started
working on the warmup performance. I picked a random PyPy from November 2014
(which is definitely before we started the warmup work) and compared it with
a recent one, after 5.0. The exact revisions are respectively <tt class="docutils literal">ffce4c795283</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">cfbb442ae368</tt>. First let's compare <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/benchmarks/src/59290b59a24e54057d4c694fa4f47e7879a347a0/warmup/?at=default">pure warmup benchmarks</a> that
can be found in our benchmarking suite. Out of those,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-graph-alloc-removal</span></tt> numbers should be taken with a grain of salt,
since other work could have influenced the results.
The rest of the benchmarks mentioned is bottlenecked purely by warmup times.</p>
<p>You can see how much your program spends in warmup running
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PYPYLOG=jit-summary:-</span> pypy <span class="pre">your-program.py</span></tt> under "tracing" and "backend"
fields (in the first three lines). An example looks like that:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[e00c145a41] {jit-summary
Tracing:        71      0.053645 &lt;- time spent tracing &amp; optimizing
Backend:        71      0.028659 &lt;- time spent compiling to assembler
TOTAL:                  0.252217 &lt;- total run time of the program

<p>As we can see, the overall warmup benchmarks got up to <strong>90% faster</strong> with
JIT time dropping by up to <strong>2.5x</strong>. We have more optimizations in the pipeline,
with an idea how to transfer some of the JIT gains into more of a total program
runtime by jitting earlier and more eagerly.</p>
<div class="section" id="details-of-the-last-round-of-optimizations">
<h1>Details of the last round of optimizations</h1>
<p>Now the nitty gritty details - what did we actually do? I covered a lot of
warmup improvements in the <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2015/10/pypy-memory-and-warmup-improvements-2-4598780879518640015.html">past</a> <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2015/09/pypy-warmup-improvements-8349465374608676233.html">blog</a> posts so I'm going to focus on
the last change, the jit-leaner-frontend branch. This last change is simple, instead of using
pointers to store the "operations" objects created during tracing, we use a compact list of
16-bit integers (with 16bit pointers in between). On 64bit machine the memory wins are
tremendous - the new representation is 4x more efficient to use 16bit pointers than full 64bit pointers.
Additionally, the smaller representation has much better cache behavior and much less
pointer chasing in memory. It also has a better defined lifespan, so we don't need to
bother tracking them by the GC, which also saves quite a bit of time.</p>
<p>The change sounds simple, but the details in the underlaying data mean that
everything in the JIT had to be changed which took quite a bit of effort :-)</p>
<p>Going into the future on the JIT front, we have an exciting set of optimizations,
ranging from faster loops through faster warmup to using better code generation
techniques and broadening the kind of program that PyPy speeds up. Stay tuned
for the updates.</p>
<p>We would like to thank our commercial partners for making all of this possible.
The work has been performed by <a class="reference external" href="https://baroquesoftware.com">baroquesoftware</a> and would not be possible
without support from people using PyPy in production. If your company uses
PyPy and want it to do more or does not use PyPy but has performance problems
with the Python installation, feel free to get in touch with me, trust me using
PyPy ends up being a lot cheaper than rewriting everything in go :-)</p>

          <p>Those benchmarks are very synthetic warmup-oriented ones. It means you exec() piece of code and then run it 2000 times and then exec again. Any other short-running programs have a lot more noise where you have multiple effects taking place and it would be really hard to compare between old and new pypy. That said it's a fair requirement, we have one more branch in the pipeline and I'll try to get more real world data.</p>

</h2>
<br>
We have released a bugfix for PyPy 5.0, after reports that the newly released
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.6.0">lxml 3.6.0</a>, which now supports PyPy 5.0 +, can <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/2260">crash on large files</a>.
Thanks to those who reported the crash. Please update, downloads are available
at<br><br><a href="../posts/2016/03/pypy.org/download.html">pypy.org/download.html</a><br><br>
The changes between PyPy 5.0 and 5.0.1 are only two bug fixes: one in
cpyext, which fixes notably (but not only) lxml; and another for a
corner case of the JIT.<br><br><h3 style="text-align: center;">
What is PyPy?</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br>
</div>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>

We also welcome developers of other
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypyjs.org/">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython can do for them.<br>

This release supports <strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, Windows 32, OpenBSD, FreeBSD),
newer <strong>ARM</strong> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux, and the
big- and little-endian variants of <strong>PPC64</strong> running Linux.<br><br>
Please update, and continue to help us make PyPy better.<br><br>
Cheers<br>

 </h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">
Faster and Leaner</h3>
<div class="section" id="new-version-numbering">
We continue to improve the warmup time and memory usage of JIT-related metadata. The exact effects depend vastly on the program you’re running and can range from insignificant to warmup being up to 30% faster and memory dropping by about 30%. </div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">
 </h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">
C-API Upgrade</h3>
<div class="section" id="vectorization">
We also merged a major upgrade to our C-API layer (cpyext), simplifying the interaction between c-level objects and PyPy interpreter level objects. As a result, lxml  (prerelease) with its cython compiled component <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/lxml">passes all tests</a> on PyPy. The new cpyext is also much faster. This major refactoring will soon be followed by an expansion of our C-API compatibility.</div>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">
Other Highlights (since 4.0.1 released in November 2015)</h3>
<ul class="simple" style="text-align: left;">
<li>New features:<ul>
<li>Support embedding PyPy in a C-program via cffi and static callbacks in cffi.<br>
This deprecates the old method of embedding PyPy</li>
<li>Refactor vmprof to work cross-operating-system, deprecate using buggy<br>
libunwind on Linux platforms. Vmprof even works on Windows now.</li>
<li>Support more of the C-API type slots, like tp_getattro, and fix C-API<br>
macros, functions, and structs such as _PyLong_FromByteArray(),<br>
PyString_GET_SIZE, f_locals in PyFrameObject, Py_NAN, co_filename in<br>
PyCodeObject</li>
<li>Use a more stable approach for allocating PyObjects in cpyext. (see<br><a class="reference external" href="../posts/2016/02/c-api-support-update-8582726091670983181.html">blog post</a>). Once the PyObject corresponding to a PyPy object is created,<br>
it stays around at the same location until the death of the PyPy object.<br>
Done with a little bit of custom GC support.  It allows us to kill the<br>
notion of “borrowing” inside cpyext, reduces 4 dictionaries down to 1, and<br>
significantly simplifies the whole approach (which is why it is a new<br>
feature while technically a refactoring) and allows PyPy to support the<br>
populart lxml module (as of the <i>next</i> release) with no PyPy specific<br>
patches needed</li>
<li>Make the default filesystem encoding ASCII, like CPython</li>
<li>Use <a class="reference external" href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/">hypothesis</a> in test creation, which is great for randomizing tests</li>
</ul>
 <ul></ul>
</li>
<li>Bug Fixes<ul>
<li>Backport always using os.urandom for uuid4 from cpython and fix the JIT as well<br>
(issue #2202)</li>
<li>More completely support datetime, optimize timedelta creation</li>
<li>Fix for issue #2185 which caused an inconsistent list of operations to be<br>
generated by the unroller, appeared in a complicated DJango app</li>
<li>Fix an elusive issue with stacklets on shadowstack which showed up when<br>
forgetting stacklets without resuming them</li>
<li>Fix entrypoint() which now acquires the GIL</li>
<li>Fix direct_ffi_call() so failure does not bail out before setting CALL_MAY_FORCE</li>
<li>Fix (de)pickling long values by simplifying the implementation</li>
<li>Fix RPython rthread so that objects stored as threadlocal do not force minor<br>
GC collection and are kept alive automatically. This improves perfomance of<br>
short-running Python callbacks and prevents resetting such object between<br>
calls</li>
<li>Support floats as parameters to itertools.isslice()</li>
<li>Check for the existence of CODESET, ignoring it should have prevented PyPy<br>
from working on FreeBSD</li>
<li>Fix for corner case (likely shown by Krakatau) for consecutive guards with<br>
interdependencies</li>
<li>Fix applevel bare class method comparisons which should fix pretty printing<br>
in IPython</li>
<li>Issues reported with our previous release were <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/whatsnew-5.0.0.html">resolved</a> after reports from users on our issue tracker at <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues">https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues</a> or on IRC at #pypy</li>
</ul>
 <ul></ul>
</li>
<li>Numpy:<ul>
<li>Updates to numpy 1.10.2 (incompatibilities and not-implemented features<br>
still exist)</li>
<li>Support dtype=((‘O’, spec)) union while disallowing record arrays with<br>
mixed object, non-object values</li>
<li>Remove all traces of micronumpy from cpyext if –withoutmod-micronumpy option used</li>
<li>Support indexing filtering with a boolean ndarray</li>
<li>Support partition() as an app-level function, together with a cffi wrapper<br>
in pypy/numpy, this now provides partial support for partition()</li>
</ul>
 <ul></ul>
</li>
<li>Performance improvements:<ul>
<li>Optimize global lookups</li>
<li>Improve the memory signature of numbering instances in the JIT. This should<br>
massively decrease the amount of memory consumed by the JIT, which is<br>
significant for most programs. Also compress the numberings using variable-<br>
size encoding</li>
<li>Optimize string concatenation</li>
<li>Use INT_LSHIFT instead of INT_MUL when possible</li>
<li>Improve struct.unpack by casting directly from the underlying buffer.<br>
Unpacking floats and doubles is about 15 times faster, and integer types<br>
about 50% faster (on 64 bit integers). This was then subsequently<br>
improved further in optimizeopt.py.</li>
<li>Optimize two-tuple lookups in mapdict, which improves warmup of instance<br>
variable access somewhat</li>
<li>Reduce all guards from int_floordiv_ovf if one of the arguments is constant</li>
<li>Identify permutations of attributes at instance creation, reducing the<br>
number of bridges created</li>
<li>Greatly improve re.sub() performance</li>
</ul>
 <ul></ul>
</li>
<li>Internal refactorings:<ul>
<li>Refactor and improve exception analysis in the annotator</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary special handling of space.wrap().</li>
<li>Support list-resizing setslice operations in RPython</li>
<li>Tweak the trace-too-long heuristic for multiple jit drivers</li>
<li>Refactor bookkeeping (such a cool word - three double letters) in the<br>
annotater</li>
<li>Refactor wrappers for OS functions from rtyper to rlib and simplify them</li>
<li>Simplify backend loading instructions to only use four variants</li>
<li>Simplify GIL handling in non-jitted code</li>
<li>Refactor naming in optimizeopt</li>
<li>Change GraphAnalyzer to use a more precise way to recognize external<br>
functions and fix null pointer handling, generally clean up external<br>
function handling</li>
<li>Remove pure variants of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getfield_gc_*</span></code> operations from the JIT by<br>
determining purity while tracing</li>
<li>Refactor databasing</li>
<li>Simplify bootstrapping in cpyext</li>
<li>Refactor rtyper debug code into python.rtyper.debug</li>
<li>Seperate structmember.h from Python.h Also enhance creating api functions<br>
to specify which header file they appear in (previously only pypy_decl.h)</li>
<li>Fix tokenizer to enforce universal newlines, needed for Python 3 support</li>
</ul>
</li>

          <p>Hi Paul.<br><br>We rerun all benchmarks on old Pythons and it shows now a different subset of benchmarks. I must admit I don't know why the main site chooses some benchmarks and not others, it's certainly not deliberate. Any single number you use is not correct, a bit by definition - we suggest you look in details what the benchmarks do or even better, benchmark yourself. We'll look why it's showing a different subset</p>

    <p>As you know, PyPy can emulate the CPython C API to some extent. In this post I will describe an important optimization that we merged to improve the performance and stability of the C-API emulation layer.</p>

<p>The C-API is implemented by passing around <code>PyObject *</code> pointers in the C code.  The problem with providing the same interface with PyPy is that
objects don't natively have the same <code>PyObject *</code> structure at all; and
additionally their memory address can change.  PyPy handles the
difference by maintaining two sets of objects.  More precisely, starting
from a PyPy object, it can allocate on demand a <code>PyObject</code> structure
and fill it with information that points back to the original PyPy
objects; and conversely, starting from a C-level object, it can allocate
a PyPy-level object and fill it with information in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>I have merged a rewrite of the interaction between C-API C-level objects
and PyPy's interpreter level objects.  This is mostly a simplification
based on a small hack in our garbage collector.  This hack makes the
garbage collector aware of the reference-counted <code>PyObject</code>
structures.  When it considers a pair consisting of a PyPy object and a
<code>PyObject</code>, it will always free either none or both of them at the
same time.  They both stay alive if <i>either</i> there is a regular GC
reference to the PyPy object, <i>or</i> the reference counter in the
<code>PyObject</code> is bigger than zero.</p>

<p>This gives a more stable result.  Previously, a PyPy object might grow a
corresponding <code>PyObject</code>, loose it (when its reference counter goes to
zero), and later have another corresponding <code>PyObject</code> re-created at a
different address.  Now, once a link is created, it remains alive until
both objects die.</p>

<p>The rewrite significantly simplifies our previous code (which used to be
based on at least 4 different dictionaries), and should make using the
C-API somewhat faster (though it is still slower than using pure
python or cffi).</p>

<p>A side effect of this work is that now PyPy actually supports the upstream <a href="https://github.com/lxml/lxml">lxml</a> package---which is is one
of the most popular packages on PyPI.  (Specifically, you need version
3.5.0 with <a href="https://github.com/lxml/lxml/pull/187">this pull
request</a> to remove old PyPy-specific hacks that were not really
working.  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/lxml">See
details</a>.)  At this point, we no longer recommend using the
<code>cffi-lxml</code> alternative: although it may still be faster, it might be
incomplete and old.</p>

<p>We are actively working on extending our C-API support, and hope to soon
merge a branch to support more of the C-API functions (some numpy news
coming!).  Please <a href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/">try
it out</a> and let us know how it works for you.</p>
