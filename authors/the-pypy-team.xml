of PyPy. For the &lt;a href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/03/fixing-bug-incremental-gc.html"&gt;GC bug
finding&lt;/a&gt;
task earlier this year, we collaborated with PortaOne and we're super happy
that Serhii Titov, head of the QA department at PortaOne, was up to writing
this guest post to describe their use and experience with the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-does-portaone-do"&gt;What does PortaOne do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We at &lt;a href="https://www.portaone.com/"&gt;PortaOne Inc.&lt;/a&gt; allow telecom operators to
launch new services (or provide existing services more efficiently) using our
VoIP platform (PortaSIP) and our real-time charging system (PortaBilling),
which provides additional features for cloud PBX, such as call transfer,
queues, interactive voice response (IVR) and more. At this moment our support
team manages several thousand servers with our software installed in 100
countries, through which over 500 telecommunication service providers connect
millions of end users every day. The unique thing about PortaOne is that we
supply the source code of our product to our customers - something unheard of
in the telecom world! Thus we attract "telco innovators", who use our APIs to
build around the system and the source code to create unique tweaks of
functionality, which produces amazing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of PortaSIP is the middle-ware component (the proper name for it is
"B2BUA", but that probably does not say much to anyone outside of experts in
VoIP), which implements the actual handling of SIP calls, messages, etc. and
all added features (for instance, trying to send a call via telco operators
through which the cost per minute is lower). It has to be fast (since even a
small delay in establishing a call is noticed by a customer), reliable
(everyone hates when a call drops or cannot be completed) and yet easily
expandable with new functionality. This is why we decided to use Python as
opposed to C/C++ or similar programming languages, which are often used in
telecom equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The B2BUA component is a batch of similar Python processes that are looped
inside a
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/asyncore.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;asyncore.dispatcher&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
wrapper. The load balancing between these Python processes is done by our
stateless SIP proxy server written in C++. All our sockets are served by this
B2BUA. We have our custom client-wrappers around &lt;code&gt;pymysql&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;redis&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;cassandra-driver&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; to communicate with external services. Some
of the Python processes use &lt;a href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cffi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
wrappers around C-code to improve their performance (examples: an Oracle DB
driver, a client to a radius server, a custom C logger).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The I/O operations that block the main thread of the Python processes are
processed in sub-threads. We have custom wrappers  around &lt;code&gt;threading.Thread&lt;/code&gt;
and also &lt;code&gt;asyncore.dispatcher&lt;/code&gt;. The results of such operations are returned to
the main thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="improving-our-performance-with-pypy"&gt;Improving our performance with PyPy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with CPython and then in 2014 switched to PyPy because it was
faster. Here's an exact quote from our first testing notes: "PyPy gives
significant performance boost, ~50%". Nowadays, after years of changes in all
the software involved, PyPy still gives us +50% boost compared to CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking care of real time traffic for so many people around the globe is
something we're really proud of. I hope the PyPy team can be proud of it as
well, as the PyPy product is a part of this solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="finding-a-garbage-collector-bug-stage-1-the-gc-hooks"&gt;Finding a garbage collector bug: stage 1, the GC hooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However our path with PyPy wasn't perfectly smooth. There were very rare cases
of crashes on PyPy that we weren't able to catch. That's because to make
coredump useful we needed to switch to PyPy with debug, but we cannot let it
run in that mode on a production system for an extended period of time, and we
did not have any STR (steps-to-reproduce) to make PyPy crash again in our lab.
That's why we kept (and still keep) both interpreters installed just in case,
and we would switch to CPython if we noticed it happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of updating PyPy from 3.5 to 3.6 our QA started noticing those
crashes more often, but we still had no luck with STR or collecting proper
coredumps with debug symbols. Then it became even worse after our development
played with the &lt;a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/gc_info.html"&gt;Garbage Collector's
options&lt;/a&gt; to increase performance
of our middleware component. The crashes started to affect our regular
performance testing (controlled by QA manager Yevhenii Bovda). At that point it
was decided that we can no longer live like that and so we started an intense
investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first stage of our investigation (following the best practice of
troubleshooting) we narrowed down the issue as much as we could. So, it was not
our code, it was definitely somewhere in PyPy. Eventually our SIP software
engineer &lt;a href="https://github.com/Yevhenii-Yatchenko"&gt;Yevhenii Yatchenko&lt;/a&gt; found out
that this bug is connected with the use of our &lt;a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/gc_info.html#gc-hooks"&gt;custom hooks in the
GC&lt;/a&gt;. Yevhenii created
ticket &lt;a href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/issues/4899"&gt;#4899&lt;/a&gt; and within 2-3 days we
got a fix from a &lt;a href="https://github.com/cfbolz"&gt;member of the PyPy team&lt;/a&gt;, in true open-source fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="finding-a-garbage-collector-bug-stage-2-the-real-bug"&gt;Finding a garbage collector bug: stage 2, the real bug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came stage 2. In parallel with the previous ticket, Yevhenii created
&lt;a href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/issues/4900"&gt;#4900&lt;/a&gt; that we still see failing
with coredumps quite often, and they are not connected to GC custom hooks. In a
nutshell, it took us dozens of back and forward emails, three Zoom sessions and
four versions of a patch to solve the issue. During the last iteration we got a
new set of options to try and a new version of the patch. Surprisingly, that
helped! What a relief! So, the next logical step was to remove all debug
options and run PyPy only with the patch. Unfortunately, it started to fail
again and we came to the obvious conclusion that what will help us is not a
patch, but one of options we were testing out. At that point we found out that
&lt;a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/gc_info.html#environment-variables"&gt;&lt;code&gt;PYPY_GC_MAX_PINNED=0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is a necessary and sufficient condition to solve our issue. This points to
another bug in the garbage collector, somehow related to object pinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's our current state: we have to add &lt;code&gt;PYPY_GC_MAX_PINNED=0&lt;/code&gt;, but we do not
face the crashes anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="conclusion-and-next-steps"&gt;Conclusion and next steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is extended to Carl for his invaluable assistance in resolving the
nasty bugss, because it seems we're the only ones who suffered from the last
one and we really did not want to fall back to CPython due to its performance
disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serhii Titov, head of the QA department at PortaOne Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you are a perfectionist and at this point you have mixed feelings and
you are still bothered by the question "But there might still be a bug in the
GC, what about that?" - Carl has some ideas about it and he will sort it out
(we will help with the testing/verification part).&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>casestudy</category><category>guestpost</category><guid>https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/08/portaone.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PyPy v7.3.11 release</title><link>https://www.pypy.org/posts/2022/12/pypy-v7311-release.html</link><dc:creator>The PyPy Team</dc:creator><description>&lt;section id="pypy-v7-3-11-release-of-python-2-7-3-8-and-3-9"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyPy v7.3.11: release of python 2.7, 3.8, and 3.9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.11 of PyPy. As could be expected,
the first release of macOS arm64 impacted the macOS x86-64 build, so this is
a bug release to restore the ability of macOS users to run PyPy on
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;macOS &amp;lt; 11.0&lt;/code&gt;. It also incorporates the latest CPython stdlib updates
released the day after 7.3.10 went out, and a few more bug fixes. The release
includes three different interpreters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is for
backported security updates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.8, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.8, including the stdlib for CPython 3.8.16. Note we intend to drop
support for this version in an upcoming release as soon as we release
Pyython 3.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.9, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.9, including the stdlib for CPython 3.9.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases and follows quickly on the heals of the 7.3.10 release on Dec 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.11 releases here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/pypy-sponsors.html"&gt;direct consulting&lt;/a&gt; work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear about
it and encourage submissions to our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/blog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; via a pull request
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org"&gt;https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: bug fixes,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/"&gt;PyPy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org"&gt;RPython&lt;/a&gt; documentation improvements, or general &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html"&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; with making
RPython's JIT even better. Since the previous release, we have accepted
contributions from one new contributor, thanks for pitching in, and welcome
to the project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hpyproject.org/"&gt;HPy&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io"&gt;CFFI&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io"&gt;cppyy&lt;/a&gt; version of your library that would be performant
on PyPy.
In any case, both &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel"&gt;cibuildwheel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild"&gt;multibuild system&lt;/a&gt; support
building wheels for PyPy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-pypy"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is PyPy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.8 and
3.9. It's fast (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org"&gt;PyPy and CPython 3.7.4&lt;/a&gt; performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also welcome developers of other &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html"&gt;dynamic languages&lt;/a&gt; to see what RPython
can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide binary builds for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;x86&lt;/strong&gt; machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS 64 bits, Windows 64 bits)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;64-bit &lt;strong&gt;ARM&lt;/strong&gt; machines running Linux (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;aarch64&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple &lt;strong&gt;M1 arm64&lt;/strong&gt; machines (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;macos_arm64&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s390x&lt;/strong&gt; running Linux&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPy support Windows 32-bit, Linux PPC64 big- and little-endian, and Linux ARM
32 bit, but does not release binaries. Please reach out to us if you wish to
sponsor binary releases for those platforms. Downstream packagers provide
binary builds for debian, Fedora, conda, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Gentoo, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PyPy v7.3.10: release of python 2.7, 3.8, and 3.9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.10 of PyPy. We have some nice
speedups and bugfixes we wish to share. The release includes three different
interpreters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is for
backported security updates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.8, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.8, including the stdlib for CPython 3.8.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.9, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.9, including the stdlib for CPython 3.9.15. We have gained
confidence in the stability of this version, and are removing the "beta"
label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. Highlights of the release, since the release of 7.3.9 in March 2022
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A release of Apple Silicon M1 arm64 versions. This work &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2022/07/m1-support-for-pypy.html"&gt;was sponsored&lt;/a&gt; by
an anonymous donor and is tested on our buildbots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many improvements to the basic interpreter to make it 15-20% faster&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conda-forge community &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2022/11/pypy-and-conda-forge.html"&gt;has built&lt;/a&gt; over 1000 packages for PyPy3.8 and 3.9,
making it easier than ever to use PyPy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update the packaged OpenSSL to 1.1.1s, sqlite3 to 3.39.4, and apply
applicable security fixes from CPython 3.9.15 to PyPy2.7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hpyproject.org/"&gt;HPy&lt;/a&gt; backend in PyPy3.8 and PyPy3.9 to 0.0.4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.10 releases here:&lt;/p&gt;

on our existing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2019/07/pypy-jit-for-aarch64-7161523403247118006.html"&gt;support for aarch64&lt;/a&gt; (arm64 on linux) with some twists
to support the differences between the CPUs and the operating system. There
are nightly builds for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/py3.8/"&gt;pypy3.8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/py3.9/"&gt;pypy3.9&lt;/a&gt; (look for &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;macos_arm64&lt;/code&gt;), and
the architecture will be part of our next release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please try it out and let us know how it is useful for you or how we could
improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still need help improving our macOS support. We have an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3697"&gt;open issue&lt;/a&gt; to
help our packaging story. Help is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PyPy v7.3.9 security release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.9 of PyPy. This is a security
release to match the recent &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/py-day-is-coming-a-joint-security-release-spree-for-python-3-7-3-8-3-9-and-3-10-on-march-14th"&gt;CPython release&lt;/a&gt; and updates the portable pypy
tarballs with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;bzip2 1.0.8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;openssl1.1.1n&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;libexpat 2.4.7&lt;/code&gt;. Along
the way this release fixes some issues discovered after the 7.3.8 release and
updates &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;sqlite3&lt;/code&gt; to 3.38.2. It includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is for
backported security updates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.7,  which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.7, including the stdlib for CPython 3.7.13. This will be the last
release of PyPy3.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.8, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.8, including the stdlib for CPython 3.8.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.9, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.9, including the stdlib for CPython 3.9.12. We relate to this as
"beta" quality. We welcome testing of this version, if you discover
incompatibilities, please report them so we can gain confidence in the version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. Highlights of the release, since the release of 7.3.8 in February 2022,
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed some failing stdlib tests on PyPy3.9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update the bundled libexpat to 2.4.6 and sqlite3 to 3.38.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.9 releases here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear about
it and encourage submissions to our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/blog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; via a pull request
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org"&gt;https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/"&gt;PyPy&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org"&gt;RPython&lt;/a&gt; documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on PyPy, or general &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html"&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; with making RPython's JIT even better. Since the
7.3.7 release, we have accepted contributions from 6 new contributors,
thanks for pitching in, and welcome to the project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hpyproject.org/"&gt;HPy&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io"&gt;CFFI&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io"&gt;cppyy&lt;/a&gt; version of your library that would be performant
on PyPy.
In any case both &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel"&gt;cibuildwheel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild"&gt;multibuild system&lt;/a&gt; support
building wheels for PyPy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-pypy"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is PyPy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.7, 3.8 and
3.9. It's fast (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org"&gt;PyPy and CPython 3.7.4&lt;/a&gt; performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also welcome developers of other &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html"&gt;dynamic languages&lt;/a&gt; to see what RPython
can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This PyPy release supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;x86&lt;/strong&gt; machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 64 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;64-bit &lt;strong&gt;ARM&lt;/strong&gt; machines running Linux. A shoutout to Huawei for sponsoring
the VM running the tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s390x&lt;/strong&gt; running Linux&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;big- and little-endian variants of &lt;strong&gt;PPC64&lt;/strong&gt; running Linux,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPy support Windows 32-bit, PPC64 big- and little-endian, and ARM 32 bit, but
does not release binaries. Please reach out to us if you wish to sponsor
releases for those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Known Issues with PyPy3.9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We slightly modified the concurrent future's &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;ProcessExcecutorPool&lt;/code&gt; to
start all the worker processes when the first task is received (like on
Python3.8) to avoid an apparent race condition when using &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; and
threads (issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3650"&gt;3650&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PyPy v7.3.8: release of python 2.7, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9-beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.8 of PyPy. It has been only a few
months since our last release, but we have some nice speedups and bugfixes we
wish to share. The release includes four different interpreters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is for
backported security updates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.7,  which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.7, including the stdlib for CPython 3.7.12. This will be the last
release of PyPy3.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.8, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.8, including the stdlib for CPython 3.8.12. This is our third
release of this interpreter, and we are removing the "beta" tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.9, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.9, including the stdlib for CPython 3.9.10. As this is our first
release of this interpreter, we relate to this as "beta" quality. We
welcome testing of this version, if you discover incompatibilities, please
report them so we can gain confidence in the version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. Highlights of the release, since the release of 7.3.7 in late October 2021,
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.9 uses an RPython version of the PEG parser which brought with it a
cleanup of the lexer and parser in general&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed a regression in PyPy3.8 when JITting empty list comprehensions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tweaked some issues around changing the file layout after packaging to make
the on-disk layout of PyPy3.8 more compatible with CPython. This requires
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;setuptools&amp;gt;=58.1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RPython now allows the target executable to have a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; in its name, so
PyPy3.9 will produce a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pypy3.9-c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;libpypy3.9-c.so&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Changing the
name of the shared object to be version-specific (it used to be
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;libpypy3-c.so&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) will allow it to live alongside other versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building PyPy3.9+ accepts a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;--platlibdir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; argument like CPython.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improvement in ssl's use of CFFI buffers to speed up &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;recv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;recvinto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update the packaged OpenSSL to 1.1.1m&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PyPy v7.3.7: bug-fix release of 3.7, 3.8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are releasing a PyPy 7.3.7 to fix the recent 7.3.6 release's binary
incompatibility with the previous 7.3.x releases. We mistakenly added fields
to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;PyFrameObject&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;PyDateTime_CAPI&lt;/code&gt; that broke the promise of binary
compatibility, which means that c-extension wheels compiled for 7.3.5 will not
work with 7.3.6 and via-versa. Please do not use 7.3.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have added a cursory test for binary API breakage to the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/binary-testing"&gt;https://github.com/pypy/binary-testing&lt;/a&gt; repo which hopefully will prevent such
mistakes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a few smaller bugs were fixed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; argument of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;fcntl.ioctl&lt;/code&gt; (issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3568"&gt;3568&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix incorrect tracing of &lt;cite&gt;while True`&lt;/cite&gt; body in 3.8 (issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3577"&gt;3577&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Properly close resources when using a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;concurrent.futures.ProcessPool&lt;/code&gt;
(issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3317"&gt;3317&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix the value of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;LIBDIR&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;_sysconfigdata&lt;/code&gt; in 3.8 (issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3582"&gt;3582&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is PyPy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.7, and
3.8. It's fast (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org"&gt;PyPy and CPython 3.7.4&lt;/a&gt; performance

&lt;p&gt;This PyPy release supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;x86&lt;/strong&gt; machines on most common operating systems

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;64-bit &lt;strong&gt;ARM&lt;/strong&gt; machines running Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s390x&lt;/strong&gt; running Linux&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPy does support ARM 32 bit and PPC64 processors, but does not release binaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PyPy v7.3.6: release of python 2.7, 3.7, and 3.8-beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.6 of PyPy, which includes
three different interpreters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is for
backported security updates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.7,  which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.7, including the stdlib for CPython 3.7.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.8, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.8, including the stdlib for CPython 3.8.12. Since this is our
first release of the interpreter, we relate to this as "beta" quality. We
welcome testing of this version, if you discover incompatibilites, please
report them so we can gain confidence in the version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. Highlights of the release, since the release of 7.3.5 in May 2021,
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have merged a backend for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hpyproject.org/"&gt;HPy&lt;/a&gt;, the better C-API interface. The backend
implements HPy version 0.0.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translation of PyPy into a binary, known to be slow, is now about 40%
faster. On a modern machine, PyPy3.8 can translate in about 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy Windows 64 is now available on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conda-forge.org/blog//2020/03/10/pypy"&gt;conda-forge&lt;/a&gt;, along with nearly 700
commonly used binary packages. This new offering joins the more than 1000
conda packages for PyPy on Linux and macOS. Many thanks to the conda-forge
maintainers for pushing this forward over the past 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed improvements were made to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;io&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;_ssl&lt;/code&gt; and more. These
were done in response to user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3.8 version of the release contains a beta-quality improvement to the
JIT to better support &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2021/09/jit-auto-generated-code.html"&gt;compiling huge Python functions&lt;/a&gt; by breaking them
up into smaller pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of Python3.8 required a concerted effort. We were greatly
helped by @isidentical (Batuhan Taskaya) and other new contributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3.8 package now uses the same layout as CPython, and many of the
PyPy-specific changes to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;sysconfig&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;distutils.sysconfig&lt;/code&gt;, and
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;distutils.commands.install.py&lt;/code&gt; have been removed. The &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;stdlib&lt;/code&gt; now
is located in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;&amp;lt;base&amp;gt;/lib/pypy3.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;posix&lt;/code&gt; systems, and in
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;&amp;lt;base&amp;gt;/Lib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on Windows. The include files on windows remain the same.
On &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;posix&lt;/code&gt; they are in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;&amp;lt;base&amp;gt;/include/pypy3.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Note we still use the
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pypy&lt;/code&gt; prefix to prevent mixing the files with CPython (which uses
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.6 releases here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear about
it and encourage submissions to our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/blog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; via a pull request
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org"&gt;https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org"&gt;PyPy&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org"&gt;RPython&lt;/a&gt; documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on PyPy, or general &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html"&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; with making RPython's JIT even better. Since the
previous release, we have accepted contributions from 7 new contributors,
thanks for pitching in, and welcome to the project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io"&gt;CFFI&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io"&gt;cppyy&lt;/a&gt; version of your library that would be performant on PyPy.

&lt;h2&gt;PyPy v7.3.5: release of 2.7 and 3.7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are releasing a PyPy 7.3.5 with bugfixes for PyPy 7.3.4, released April 4.
PyPy 7.3.4 was the first release that runs on windows 64-bit, so that support
is still "beta". We are releasing it in the hopes that we can garner momentum
for its continued support, but are already aware of some problems, for instance
it errors in the NumPy test suite (issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3462"&gt;3462&lt;/a&gt;). Please help out with testing
the release and reporting successes and failures, financially supporting our
ongoing work, and helping us find the source of these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new windows 64-bit builds improperly named c-extension modules
with the same extension as the 32-bit build (issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3443"&gt;3443&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the windows-specific &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;PC/pyconfig.h&lt;/code&gt; rather than the posix one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix the return type for &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;_Py_HashDouble&lt;/code&gt; which impacts 64-bit windows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A change to the python 3.7 &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;sysconfig.get_config_var('LIBDIR')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; was wrong,
leading to problems finding &lt;cite&gt;libpypy3-c.so&lt;/cite&gt; for embedded PyPy (issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3442"&gt;3442&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instantiate &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;distutils.command.install&lt;/code&gt; schema for PyPy-specific
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;implementation_lower&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delay thread-checking logic in greenlets until the thread is actually started
(continuation of issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3441"&gt;3441&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four upstream (CPython) security patches were applied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue42988"&gt;BPO 42988&lt;/a&gt; to remove &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pydoc.getfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue43285"&gt;BPO 43285&lt;/a&gt; to not trust the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;PASV&lt;/code&gt; response in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;ftplib&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue43075"&gt;BPO 43075&lt;/a&gt; to remove a possible ReDoS in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;urllib&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;AbstractBasicAuthHandler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue43882"&gt;BPO 43882&lt;/a&gt; to sanitize urls containing ASCII newline and tabs in
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;urllib.parse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix for json-specialized dicts (issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3460"&gt;3460&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialize &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;ByteBuffer.setslice&lt;/code&gt; which speeds up binary file reading by a
factor of 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When assigning the full slice of a list, evaluate the rhs before clearing the
list (issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3440"&gt;3440&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Python2, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;PyUnicode_Contains&lt;/code&gt; accepts bytes as well as unicode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finish fixing &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;_sqlite3&lt;/code&gt; - untested &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;_reset()&lt;/code&gt; was missing an argument
(issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3432"&gt;3432&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update the packaged sqlite3 to 3.35.5 on windows. While not a bugfix, this
seems like an easy win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend updating. These fixes are the direct result of end-user bug
reports, so please continue reporting issues as they crop up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PyPy v7.3.4: release of python 2.7 and 3.7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyPy team is proud to release the version 7.3.4 of PyPy, which includes
two different interpreters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is for
backported security updates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPy3.7,  which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.7, including the stdlib for CPython 3.7.10. We no longer refer to
this as beta-quality as the last incompatibilities with CPython (in the
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;re&lt;/code&gt; module) have been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are no longer releasing a Python3.6 version, as we focus on updating to
Python 3.8. We have begun streaming the advances towards this goal on Saturday
evenings European time on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.twitch.tv/pypyproject"&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/pypyproject&lt;/a&gt;. If Python3.6 is
important to you, please reach out as we could offer sponsored longer term
support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. Highlights of the release include binary &lt;strong&gt;Windows 64&lt;/strong&gt; support,
faster numerical instance fields, and a preliminary HPy backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new contributor (Ondrej Baranovič - thanks!) took us up on the challenge to get
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/2073#note_141389"&gt;windows 64-bit&lt;/a&gt; support.  The work has been merged and for the first time we
are releasing a 64-bit Windows binary package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release contains the biggest change to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2010/11/efficiently-implementing-python-objects-3838329944323946932.html"&gt;PyPy's implementation of the
instances of user-defined classes&lt;/a&gt; in many years. The optimization was
motivated by the report of performance problems running a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/paugier/nbabel"&gt;numerical particle
emulation&lt;/a&gt;. We implemented an optimization that stores &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;
instance fields in an unboxed way, as long as these fields are type-stable
(meaning that the same field always stores the same type, using the principle
of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~cbatten/pdfs/cheng-type-freezing-cgo2020.pdf"&gt;type freezing&lt;/a&gt;). This gives significant performance improvements on
numerical pure-Python code, and other code where instances store many integers
or floating point numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also a number of optimizations for methods around strings and bytes,
following user reported performance problems. If you are unhappy with PyPy's
performance on some code of yours, please report &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/"&gt;an issue&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major new feature is prelminary support for the Universal mode of HPy: a
new way of writing c-extension modules to totally encapsulate &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;PyObject*&lt;/code&gt;.
The goal, as laid out in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;HPy documentation&lt;/a&gt; and recent &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hpyproject.org/blog/posts/2021/03/hello-hpy/"&gt;HPy blog post&lt;/a&gt;,
is to enable a migration path
for c-extension authors who wish their code to be performant on alternative
interpreters like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/graalvm/graalpython"&gt;GraalPython&lt;/a&gt; (written on top of the Java virtual machine),
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython"&gt;RustPython&lt;/a&gt;, and PyPy. Thanks to Oracle and IBM for sponsoring work on HPy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://vmprof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;vmprof&lt;/a&gt; statistical profiler has been extended to ARM64 via a
built-in backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several issues exposed in the 7.3.3 release were fixed. Many of them came from the
great work ongoing to ship PyPy-compatible binary packages in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conda-forge.org/blog//2020/03/10/pypy"&gt;conda-forge&lt;/a&gt;.
A big shout out to them for taking this on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of PyPy takes place on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy"&gt;https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy&lt;/a&gt;.
We have seen an increase in the number of drive-by contributors who are able to
use gitlab + mercurial to create merge requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io"&gt;CFFI&lt;/a&gt; backend has been updated to version 1.14.5 and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io"&gt;cppyy&lt;/a&gt; backend
to 1.14.2. We recommend using CFFI rather than C-extensions to interact with C,
and using cppyy for performant wrapping of C++ code for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we strongly recommend updating to the latest versions. Many fixes
are the direct result of end-user bug reports, so please continue reporting
issues as they crop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find links to download the v7.3.4 releases here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear about
it and encourage submissions to our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/blog"&gt;renovated blog site&lt;/a&gt; via a pull request
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org"&gt;https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/"&gt;PyPy&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org"&gt;RPython&lt;/a&gt; documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on PyPy, or general &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html"&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; with making RPython's JIT even better. Since the
previous release, we have accepted contributions from 10 new contributors,
thanks for pitching in, and welcome to the project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a cffi / cppyy version of your library that would be performant on PyPy.
In any case both &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel"&gt;cibuildwheel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild"&gt;multibuild system&lt;/a&gt; support
building wheels for PyPy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-pypy"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is PyPy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.7, and
soon 3.8. It's fast (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org"&gt;PyPy and CPython 3.7.4&lt;/a&gt; performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also welcome developers of other &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html"&gt;dynamic languages&lt;/a&gt; to see what RPython
can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This PyPy release supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;x86&lt;/strong&gt; machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32/64 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;big- and little-endian variants of &lt;strong&gt;PPC64&lt;/strong&gt; running Linux,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s390x&lt;/strong&gt; running Linux&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;64-bit &lt;strong&gt;ARM&lt;/strong&gt; machines running Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPy does support ARM 32 bit processors, but does not release binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-else-is-new"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What else is new?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about the 7.3.4 release, see the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/release-v7.3.4.html#changelog"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please update, and continue to help us make PyPy better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
The PyPy team&lt;/p&gt;
