Keeping a project as ambitious as PyPy requires resources. Sometimes the
problems encountered are general, like updating python versions or supporting
various c-extensions. Sometimes the problems are specific and require precise
solutions that may not generalize to all users. Likewise, sponsorship of PyPy
can be general or specific.

## General PyPy Sponsorship

PyPy has had many [financial contributors](categories/sponsors.html) in the
past. We are grateful to them, and to the following current sponsors:

- [![Baroque Software logo](/images/baroque-software.png

  master](https://buildbot.pypy.org) as well as our [benchmark
  runner](https://speed.pypy.org/about/)

- The recurring and once-off fiscal sponsors via
  [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/pypy#section-top-financial-contributors)

- Others providing buildbot workers
