<p>One of the RaspberryPi's goals is to be a fun toolkit for school children (and adults!) to learn programming and electronics with. Python and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pygame.org">pygame</a> are part of this toolkit. Recently the RaspberryPi Foundation <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2013/05/pypy-20-alpha-for-arm.html">funded</a> parts of the effort of porting of <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/">pypy</a> to the Pi -- making Python programs on the Pi faster!</p>
<p>Unfortunately pygame is written as a Python C extension that wraps <a class="reference external" href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> which means performance of pygame under pypy remains mediocre. To fix this pygame needs to be rewritten using <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org">cffi</a> to wrap SDL instead.</p>
<p>RaspberryPi sponsored a <a class="reference external" href="https://ctpug.org.za/wiki/Meeting20131207">CTPUG (Cape Town Python User Group)</a> hackathon to put together a proof-of-concept pygame-cffi. The day was quite successful - we got a basic version of the bub'n'bros client working on pygame-cffi (and on PyPy). The results can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CTPUG/pygame_cffi">on github</a> with contributions from the five people present at the sprint.</p>
<p>While far from complete, the proof of concept does show that there are no major obstacles to porting pygame to cffi and that cffi is a great way to bind your Python package to C libraries.</p>
<p>Amazingly, we managed to have machines running all three major platforms (OS X, Linux and Windows) at the hackathon so the code runs on all of them!</p>
<p>We would like to thank the Praekelt foundation for providing the venue and The Raspberry Pi foundation for providing food and drinks!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Simon Cross, Jeremy Thurgood, Neil Muller, David Sharpe and fijal.</p>
