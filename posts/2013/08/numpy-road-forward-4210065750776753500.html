<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>This is the roadmap for numpy effort in PyPy as discussed on the London sprint.
First, the highest on our priority list is to finish the low-level part
of the numpy module. What
we'll do is to finish the RPython part of numpy and provide a pip installable
numpypy repository that includes the pure python part of Numpy. This would
contain the original Numpy with a few minor changes.</p>
<p>Second, we need to work on the JIT support that will make NumPy on PyPy
faster. In detail:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>reenable the lazy loop evaluation</li>
<li>optimize bridges, which is depending on optimizer refactorings</li>
<li>SSE support</li>
</ul>
<p>On the compatibility front, there were some independent attempts into
making the following stuff working:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>f2py</li>
<li>C API (in fact, PyArray_* API is partly present in the nightly builds of
PyPy)</li>
<li>matplotlib (both using PyArray_* API and embedding CPython runtime in PyPy)</li>
<li>scipy</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to make all of the above happen faster, it would be helpful to raise
more funds. You can donate to <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/numpydonate.html">PyPy's NumPy project</a> on our website. Note
that PyPy is a member of SFC which is a 501(c)(3) US non-profit, so donations
from US companies can be tax-deducted.</p>
