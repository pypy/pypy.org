<html><body><p>This is the 12th status update about our work on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/all/tip/branch%28%22py3k%22%29">py3k branch</a>, which we<br>
can work on thanks to all of the people who <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/01/py3k-and-numpy-first-stage-thanks-to.html">donated</a> to the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/py3donate.html">py3k proposal</a>.</p><p>Here's an update on the recent progress:</p><ul class="simple"><li>Thank you to everyone who has provided initial feedback on the PyPy3 2.1 beta<br>
1 release. We've gotten a number of bug reports, most of which have been<br>
fixed.</li>
<li>As usual, we're continually keeping up with changes from the default<br>
branch. Oftentimes these merges come at a cost (conflicts and or<br>
reintegration of py3k changes) but occasionally we get goodies for free, such<br>
as the <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2013/10/making-coveragepy-faster-under-pypy.html">recent JIT optimizations</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2013/10/incremental-garbage-collector-in-pypy.html">incremental garbage collection</a>.</li>
<li>We've been focusing on re-optimizing Python 2 int sized (machine sized)<br>
integers:</li>
</ul><p>We have a couple of known, notable speed regressions in the PyPy3 beta release<br>
vs regular PyPy. The major one being with Python 2.x int sized (or machine<br>
sized) integers.</p><p>Python 3 drops the distinction between int and long types. CPython 3.x<br>
accomplishes this by removing the old int type entirely and renaming the long<br>
type to int. Initially, we've done the same for PyPy3 for the sake of<br>
simplicity and getting everything working.</p><p>However PyPy's JIT is capable of heavily optimizing these machine sized integer<br>
operations, so this came with a regression in performance in this area.</p><p>We're now in the process of solving this. Part of this work also involves some<br>
house cleaning on these numeric types which also benefits the default branch.</p><p>cheers,<br>
Phil</p></body></html>
