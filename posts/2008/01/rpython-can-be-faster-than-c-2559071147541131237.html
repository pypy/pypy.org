<html><body><p>(yes, C as in language, not c as in speed of light). I looked recently at the great computer language shootout, for some benchmarks and to make some speed comparisons. I use <a href="https://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=binarytrees&amp;lang=all">this</a> benchmark, modified it to be rpythonic-enough and compared speeds. The code is <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/user/fijal/targetshootout.py">here</a> (the only change from the Python version was to create a class instead of tuple, so actually this version is <i>more</i> OO). Also the benchmark is very likely flawed because it favours better GCs :).<br>
So, here we go:

</p><table>
<tr><td>Language:</td><td>Time of run (for N=14):</td></tr>
<tr><td>Python version running on Python 2.5.1, distribution</td><td>25.5s</td></tr>
<tr><td>Python version running on PyPy with generational GC</td><td>45.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Python with psyco</td><td>20s</td></tr>
<tr><td>RPython translated to C using PyPy's generational GC</td><td>0.42s</td></tr>
<tr><td>compiling the Haskell version with GHC 6.6.1</td><td>1.6s</td></tr>
<tr><td>compiling the C version with gcc 4.1.2 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer</td><td>0.6s</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>

Also worth noticing is that when using psyco with the original version (with tuples) it is very fast (2s).<br><br>

So, PyPy's Python interpreter is 80% slower than CPython on this (not too horrible), but RPython is 40% faster than gcc here. Cool. The result is mostly due to our GC, which also proves that manual memory-management can be <i>slower</i> than garbage collection in some situations. Please note that this result does not mean that RPython is meant for <b>you</b>. It requires a completely different mindset than the one used to program in Python. <i>Don't say you weren't warned! :-)</i></body></html>
