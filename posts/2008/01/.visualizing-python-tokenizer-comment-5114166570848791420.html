<html><body><p>Hello!<br><br>I was considering to use<br><br>https://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Antlr3PythonTarget<br><br>for a toy language project for uni (Computer Engineering, IT) because I guess ANTLR(works) and its mailing list could help me a lot in understanding the very basics of 'grammar design'...<br><br>Or at least I hope so! :-)<br><br>However, I've also been lurking the PyPy ml for quite a while now and was considering the possibility to implement the whole (*toy*) interpreter in RPython, so to understand a bit more of PyPy's design by actually coding something simple which makes some use of it. :-)<br><br>So, would you consider trying to port the current ANTLR's Python runtime to RPython a good way for me to start doing something with PyPy?<br><br>Would you consider the thing interesting? I know this possibility had been discussed on IRC some times ago and it wasn't thought to be that useful at last, but maybe you discussed the thing some more since then and changed idea, I don't know...<br><br>How would you rate the difficulty of such a task for a PyPy and ANTLR newbie, also? :-)<br><br>I wouldn't try doing that right now, anyway, but maybe in March I should manage to get some spare time for it. In the meantime, I'd try to read as many docs and sources as possible...<br><br>Tell me your opinion, please! :-)<br><br>Cheers,<br>Matteo<br><br>PS: I'm writing here because you were discussing PyPy's Python lexer and somebody wrote about ANTLRworks, but if you think I'd better send this message to the list please just tell me and I'll do so! :-)</p></body></html>
