<html><body><p>Following the great success of <a class="reference" href="https://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/codeswarm/">code_swarm</a>, I recently produced a
video that shows the commit history of the PyPy project.</p>
<p>The video shows the commits under the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dist/</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">branch/</span></tt>
directories, which is where most of the development happens.</p>
<p>In the first part of the video, you can see clearly our <a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/dev_method.html">sprint based
approach</a>: the video starts in February 2003, when the first PyPy
sprint took place in Hildesheim: after a lot of initial activity, few
commits happened in the next two months, until the second PyPy sprint,
which took place in Gothenburg in late May 2003; around the minute
0:15, you can see the high commit rate due to the sprint.</p>
<p>The next two years follow more or less the same pattern: very high
activity during sprints, followed by long pauses between them; the
most interesting breaking point is located around the minute 01:55;
it's January 2005, and when the EU project starts, the number of
commits just explodes, as well as the number of people involved.</p>
<p>I also particularly appreciated minute 03:08 aka March 22, 2006: it's
the date of my first commit to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dist/</span></tt>, and my nickname magically
appears; but of course I'm biased :-).</p>
<p>The soundtrack is <a class="reference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_I%E2%80%93IV">NIN - Ghosts IV - 34</a>: thanks to xoraxax for
having added the music and uploaded the video.</p>
