<html><body><p>Let's see who entered that line:<br><br> 4361        pje     # This proves SA can handle a class with non-string dict keys<br>  4361        pje     locals()[42] = 99   # Don't remove this line!<br><br><br>pje ?  Yes.   <a href="https://dirtsimple.org/" rel="nofollow">That PJE</a>.  Complete with "don't remove this!"....we'll have to see what mr. guru was up to with that one.  This test is also only present in the 0.5 branch which hasn't had alpha releases yet.<br><br>Would love to hear some other examples of "obscure details" the test suite is relying upon...my guess would be extremely few or none besides this one example.</p></body></html>
