      <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Some news from the JIT front.  Progress on the JIT has been low-profile
in the past few months.  No big results to announce yet, but we have
played with some new ideas, and they are now documented as a draft
research paper: <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/user/cfbolz/jitpl/paper/prologjit1.pdf">Towards Just-In-Time Compilation and Specialisation of Prolog.</a></p>

<p>Prolog?  Yes.  To understand this slightly unusual choice of programming
language, here is first some background about our JIT.</p>

<p>PyPy contains not a JIT but a <i>JIT generator,</i> which means that we
only write an interpreter for a language (say, the complete Python
language), and we get a JIT "for free".  More precisely, it's not for
free: we had to write the JIT generator, of course, as well as some
amount of subtle generic support code.  The JIT generator preprocesses
the (complete Python) interpreter that we wrote and links the result
with the generic support code; the result is a (complete Python) JIT.</p>

<p>The way that this works so far gives us a generated JIT that is very
similar to <a href="https://psyco.sourceforge.net">Psyco</a> in the way
it works.
But Psyco has issues (and so the current PyPy JITs have the same issues):
it can sometimes produce too much machine code,
e.g. by failing to notice that two versions of the machine code are
close enough that they should really be one; and it can also sometimes
fail in the opposite way, by making a single sub-efficient version of
the machine code instead of several efficient specialized versions.</p>

<p>A few months ago we have chosen to experiment with improving this
instead of finishing and polishing what we had so far.  The choice was
mostly because we were (and still are) busy finishing and polishing
everything else in PyPy, so it was more fun to keep at least the JIT on
the experimental side.  Besides, PyPy is now getting to a rather good
and complete state, and it is quite usable without the JIT already.</p>

<p>Anyway, enough excuses.  Why is this about Prolog?</p>

<p>In PyPy, both the (complete Python) interpreter and the JIT support code
are in RPython.  Now RPython is not
an extremely complicated language, but still, it is far from the top on a
minimalism scale.  In general, this is a good in practice (or at least I
think so): it gives
a reasonable balance because it is convenient to write interpreters
in RPython, while not being so bloated that it makes our translation
toolchain horribly complicated (e.g. writing garbage collectors for
RPython - or even JIT generators - is reasonable).  Still, it is not the
best choice for early research-level experimentation.</p>

<p>So what we did instead recently is hand-write, in Prolog, a JIT that
looks similar to what we would like to achieve for RPython with our JIT
generator.  This gave much quicker turnaround times than we were used to
when we played around directly with RPython.  We wrote tiny example
interpreters in Prolog (of course not a complete Python interpreter).
Self-inspection is trivial in Prolog, and generating Prolog code at
runtime is very easy too.  Moreover, many other issues are also easier
in Prolog: for example, all data structures are immutable "terms".
Other languages than Prolog would have worked, too, but it happens to be
one that we (Carl Friderich, Michael Leuschel and myself) are familiar
with -- not to mention that it's basically a nice small dynamic
language.</p>

<p>Of course, all this is closely related to what we want to do in PyPy.
The fundamental issues are the same.  Indeed, in PyPy, the major goals
of the JIT are to remove, first, the overhead of allocating objects all
the time (e.g. integers), and second, the overhead of dynamic dispatch
(e.g. finding out that it's integers we are adding).  The equivalent
goals in Prolog are, first, to avoid creating short-lived terms, and
second, to remove the overhead of dispatch (typically, the dispatching
to multiple clauses).  If you are familiar with Prolog you can find more
details about this <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/user/cfbolz/jitpl/paper/prologjit1.pdf">in the paper.</a> So far we already played with many possible solutions
in the Prolog JIT, and the paper describes the most mature one; we have
more experimentation in mind.  The main point here is that these are
mostly language-independent techniques (anything that works both in
Prolog and in RPython has to be language-independent, right? :-)</p>

<p>In summary, besides the nice goal of speeding up Prolog, we are trying
to focus our Prolog JIT on the issues and goals that have equivalents in
the PyPy JIT generator.  So in the end we are pretty convinced that it
will give us something that we can backport to PyPy -- good ideas about
what works and what doesn't, as well as some concrete algorithms.</p>

          <p>One thing I've never quite understood: how will the JIT-generation transform interact with more traditional optimization schemes?<br><br>Concrete example: say in a function I want to perform some algebraic reductions of math operations which will change a lot of the instructions.  Since the JIT generation turns the interpreter into a JIT, presumably I have to write the optimization at the interpreter level.  <br><br>I can see how that could work for the simplest kind of optimizations (special cases should be specialized at runtime after they go green, if I understand the rainbow colour scheme.)<br><br>I don't see yet how the more complex optimizations I'd write on static, fixed-type code will look in this context.  IIUC at interpreter level I can only access the JIT's observations via tests like "if type(a) == FloatType" which should be filled after they're known-- but that's inside the function itself, and I don't see how to access that information from anything outside.</p>

          <p>dsm: This is a two-level approach, corresponding to two levels of optimisations that are useful for dynamic languages like Python: the "high level" is the unboxing and dispatching removing that I describe in the post (which by itself can give something like a factor 50-100 speed-up in the best cases).  Traditional "low level" optimisations can be performed on top of that, by optimising the generated code that comes out of the "high level" (and this could give another 2-4x speed-up, i.e. the same difference as between "gcc" and "gcc -O3").<br><br>In this Prolog experiment we are only focusing on how to get the high level optimisations.</p>

          <p>Shalabh: It's also important to note 3 big benefits of implementing a language in the language itself, or a subset thereof ("turtles all the way down").<br><br>(1) Debugging and testing tools for programs written in the language then (hopefully) also work for debugging and testing the language implementation with minimal (or no) modification.  This also HUGELY lowers the bar for ordinary users of the language to find and fix implementation bugs.  This isn't a fault of Prolog, but 99.99% of Python users won't touch a Prolog debugger with a 10-foot pole.<br><br>(2) The largest pool of people most interested in improving the language is presumably the expert heavy users of the language.  Forcing them to learn a new language and/or implement the language in a language outside their expertise is a large disadvatage.<br><br>(3) The difference between language builtins and user code is reduced.  Also, it forces certain powerful constructs to (at times) be exposed in the language when they might otherwise only be exposed in the implementation language.  Also, with "turtles all the way down", performance improvements in the language itself also often apply to the language builtins, which increases the benefit of improvements, which is important in the cost/benefit analysis for undertaking the performance improvements in the first place.  Having "turtles all the way down" make some optimizations worthwhile that otherwise would be too much trouble to implement.</p>
