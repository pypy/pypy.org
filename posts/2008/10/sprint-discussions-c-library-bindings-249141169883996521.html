<html><body><p>At the beginning of this year, PyPy grew <a class="reference" href="/posts/2008/02/running-pyglet-on-pypy-3191536711417589549.html">ctypes support</a>, thanks to generous
<a class="reference" href="/posts/2008/06/pypy-improvements-5272963843122158791.html">support by Google</a>. This made it possible to interface with C libraries from
our Python interpreter, something that was possible but <a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/rffi.html">rather tedious</a> before.
What we are lacking so far is a way to interface to large C++ libraries (like
GUI libraries). During the sprint we had a brainstorming session about possible
approaches for fixing this shortcoming.</p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/SPSLYmHqcDI/AAAAAAAAAFk/1qE8zrafv7c/s1600-h/cpp_bindings.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5256979919714021426" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/SPSLYmHqcDI/AAAAAAAAAFk/1qE8zrafv7c/s320/cpp_bindings.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;"></a><p>For CPython there are a number of approaches in common use:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference" href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/intro">SIP</a>, mainly used for <a class="reference" href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">PyQT</a></li>
<li><a class="reference" href="https://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a></li>
<li><a class="reference" href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/python/doc/index.html">Boost.Python</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Those all have the property that they produce some code that is then compiled
with a compiler to produce a CPython extension. The produced code also uses
functions from CPython's C-API. This model is not simple to use for PyPy in its
current state. Since PyPy generates C code automatically, a fixed C-level API
does not exist (it is not unlikely that at one point in the future we might have
to provide one, but not yet). At the moment, PyPy very much has a "Don't call
us, we call you"-approach.</p>
<p>A very different approach is followed by the <a class="reference" href="https://seal-reflex.web.cern.ch/seal-reflex/index.html">Reflex package</a>, which is
developed at CERN (which has an incredible amount of C++ libraries). It is not
mainly intended for writing Python bindings for C++ libraries but instead
provides reflection capabilities for C++. The idea is that for every C++ shared
library, an additional shared library is produced, which allows together with
Reflex to introspect properties of C++ classes, methods, etc. at runtime. These
facilities are then used for writing a small generic CPython extension module,
that allows CPython to use any C++ library for which this reflection information
was generated.</p>
<p>This approach is a bit similar to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ctypes</span></tt> module, apart from the fact
that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ctypes</span></tt> does not use any reflection information, but the user has to
specify the data structures that occur in the C code herself. This makes it
sometimes rather burdensome to write cross-platform library bindings.</p>
<p>For PyPy the approach seems rather fitting: We would need to implement only the
generic extension module and could then use any number of C++ libraries. Of
course some more evaluation is needed (e.g. to find out whether there are any
restrictions for the C++ code that the library can use and how bothersome it is
to get this reflection information for a large library) but so far it seems
promising.</p></body></html>
