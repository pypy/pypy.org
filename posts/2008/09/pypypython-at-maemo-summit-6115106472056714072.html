<html><body><p>Maciej and me visited the <a class="reference" href="https://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2008">Maemo Summit</a> in Berlin -
a community meetup around Nokia's Linux based
mobile platform.  We spontaneously did a lightning
talk about a first running pypy-c on Maemo
and got nice feedback.  

</p><p>We also had a nice lunch with guys from the <a href="https://www.indt.org.br/institutional/index.php">INDT</a> in Brazil, including Marcio Marcedo and <a href="https://www.marceloeduardo.com/blog/">Marcelo Eduardo</a>.  It turns out that Python is used a lot on Maemo, for example the nice <a>Canola</a> UI is done with it.  Will be interesting to see how this shapes up in relation to the iPhone and Android.

</p><p>A lot of Nokia engineers were around and they announced that from October on they are going for weekly new releases of their SDK for the new Fremantle (Maemo-5) debian-based platform until the SDK becomes final - if we got this right.  

</p><p>Funnily enough, we met <a href="https://mg.pov.lt/blog">Marius Gedminas</a> from the Programmers of Vilnius - he gave a lightning talk on his impressions as a community member.  We think python programmers really should go much more to non-Python centric conferences.

</p><p>The whole event took place at the <a href="https://www.c-base.org">C-Base</a> - was a bit
crammed in some of the <a href="https://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2008">sessions</a> with something like 200 people attending.
