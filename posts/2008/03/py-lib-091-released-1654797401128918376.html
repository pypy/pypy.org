<html><body><p>The <a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/py">Py-Lib</a> 0.9.1 release is out! The Py-Lib is a very important support
library that PyPy uses for a lot of things – most importantly it contains
<a class="reference" href="https://codespeak.net/py/dist/test.html">py.test</a>, which PyPy uses for testing.</p>
<p>This is mostly a bugfix release, with a couple of new features sneaked in.
Most important changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>some new functionality (authentication, export, locking) in py.path's
Subversion APIs</li>
<li>numerous small fixes in py.test's rsession (experimental pluggable session)
and generative test features</li>
<li>some fixes in the py.test core</li>
</ul>
