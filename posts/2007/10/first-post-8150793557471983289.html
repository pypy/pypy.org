<html><body><p>Welcome to the PyPy status blog. After we got a lot of positive feedback about the blog coverage of our <a href="https://pypysqueak.blogspot.com/">Squeak/PyPy sprint in Bern<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></a> we decided that having a general PyPy blog sounds like a good idea. We will try to periodically post about what is going on in the PyPy project, cover sprints and other events where PyPyers are present. If you have any wishes about things we should write about, feel free to leave a comment.</p></body></html>
