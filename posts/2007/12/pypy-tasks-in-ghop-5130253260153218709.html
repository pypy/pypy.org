<html><body><p>In the latest bunch of tasks that Titus released on Friday for the <a href="https://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/">Google Highly Open Participation Contest</a> there are several that are related to PyPy. Some of them are about presenting PyPy to a technical audience: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/detail?id=187">Task 187</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/detail?id=188">Task 188</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/detail?id=189">Task 189</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/detail?id=190">Task 190</a>.

Then there are some three about Ropes, which are all rather challenging:
</p><ul><li>Solving the first three section of the last <a href="https://www.icfpcontest.org/">ICFP contest</a> with <a href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2007/11/ropes-branch-merged.html">PyPy's ropes implementation</a>:<a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/detail?id=248">Task 248</a>.</li><li>Implementing nice wrapper classes around PyPy's <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist/pypy/rlib/rope.py">ropes algorithms</a> to make their use convenient: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/detail?id=239">Task 239</a>.</li><li>Implementing the Ropes algorithms in C as a CPython extension module: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/detail?id=218">Task 218</a> (already taken).</li></ul>
In addition there is a task to use PyPy's <a href="https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/sandbox.html">sandboxing features</a> to provide an interactive Python tutorial on a web page: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/detail?id=220">Task 220</a>.

We're really looking forward to working together with some bright students!</body></html>
