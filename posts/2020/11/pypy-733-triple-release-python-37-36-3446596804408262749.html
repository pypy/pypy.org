<html><body><p> The PyPy team is proud to release the version 7.3.3 of PyPy, which includes
three different interpreters:
</p><blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple"><li>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18 (updated from the
previous version)</li><li>PyPy3.6: which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.6, including the stdlib for CPython 3.6.12 (updated from the
previous version).</li><li>PyPy3.7 beta: which is our second release of an interpreter supporting the
syntax and the features of Python 3.7, including the stdlib for CPython
3.7.9. We call this beta quality software, there may be issues about
compatibility with new and changed features in CPython 3.7.
Please let us know what is broken or missing. We have not implemented the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#re">documented changes</a> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">re</span></code> module, and a few other pieces are also
missing. For more information, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/wikis/py3.7%20status">PyPy 3.7 wiki</a> page</li></ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the 7.3
releases, but read on to find out what is new.</p>
<p>Several issues found in the 7.3.2 release were fixed. Many of them came from the
great work by <a class="reference external" href="https://conda-forge.org/blog//2020/03/10/pypy">conda-forge</a> to ship PyPy binary packages.  A big shout out
to them for taking this on.</p>
<p>Development of PyPy has moved to <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy">https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy</a>.
This was covered more extensively in this <a class="reference external" href="/posts/2020/02/pypy-and-cffi-have-moved-to-heptapod-5791595152472747032.html">blog post</a>. We have seen an
increase in the number of drive-by contributors who are able to use gitlab +
mercurial to create merge requests.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io">CFFI</a> backend has been updated to version 1.14.3. We recommend using CFFI
rather than c-extensions to interact with C, and using <a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io">cppyy</a> for performant
wrapping of C++ code for Python.</p>
<p>A new contributor took us up on the challenge to get <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/windows.html#what-is-missing-for-a-full-64-bit-translation">windows 64-bit</a> support.
The work is proceeding on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win64</span></code> branch, more help in coding or
sponsorship is welcome. In anticipation of merging this large change, we fixed
many test failures on windows.</p>
<p>As always, this release fixed several issues and bugs.  We strongly recommend
updating. Many of the fixes are the direct result of end-user bug reports, so
please continue reporting issues as they crop up.</p>

<p>We would like to thank our <a href="https://opencollective.com/pypy">donors</a> for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/index.html">PyPy</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on pypy, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython’s JIT even better. Since the
previous release, we have accepted contributions from 2 new contributors,
thanks for pitching in.</p>
<p>If you are a python library maintainer and use c-extensions, please consider
making a cffi / cppyy version of your library that would be performant on PyPy.
In any case both <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel">cibuildwheel</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild">multibuild system</a> support
building wheels for PyPy.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">What is PyPy?</span></h2>
<p>PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7, 3.6, and
3.7. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">PyPy and CPython 3.7.4</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.</p>
<p>This PyPy release supports:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple"><li><b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li><li>big- and little-endian variants of <b>PPC64</b> running Linux,</li><li><b>s390x</b> running Linux</li><li>64-bit <b>ARM</b> machines running Linux.</li></ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>PyPy does support ARM 32 bit processors, but does not release binaries.</p><p> </p><h2 style="text-align: center;">
