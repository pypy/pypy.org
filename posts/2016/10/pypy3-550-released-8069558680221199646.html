<html><body><p>We're pleased to announce the release of PyPy3 v5.5.0. Coming four months after PyPy3.3 v5.2, it improves compatibility with Python 3.3 (3.3.5). We strongly recommend updating from previous PyPy3 versions.<br>
<br>
We would like to thank all of the people who donated to the py3k proposal for supporting the work that went into this release.<br>
<br>
You can download the PyPy3.3 v5.5.0 release here: <a href="https://pypy.org/download.html#python-3-3-5-compatible-pypy3-3-v5-5">https://pypy.org/download.html</a><br>
</p><ul>
<li>Improved Python 3.3.5 support.</li>
<ul>
<li>os.get_terminal_size(), time.monotonic(), str.casefold() </li>
<li>faulthandler module</li>
<li>There are still some missing features such as a PEP 393-like space efficient string representation and including performance regressions (e.g. issue #2305). The focus for this release has been updating to 3.3 compatibility. Windows is also not yet supported.</li>
</ul>
<li><i>ensurepip</i> is also included (it's only included in CPython 3 &gt;= 3.4).</li>
<li>Buffer interface improvements (numpy on top of cpyext)</li>
<li>Several JIT improvements (force-virtual-state, residual calls)</li>
<li>Search path for libpypy-c.so has changed (helps with cffi embedding on linux distributions)</li>
<li>Improve the error message when the user forgot the "self" argument of a method</li>

<h3>
Towards Python 3.5</h3>
<div>
<div>
We have started to work on Python 3.5, which is a version used by many software projects. It seems to get wide adoption. We are happy to be part of the Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) initiative.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
Nevertheless we want to give our users the chance to use PyPy in their Python 3 projects, thus we have prepared this release.</div>
</div>
<h3>
What is PyPy?</h3>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7.10 and 3.3.5. It's fast due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><span><br></span></span> We also welcome developers of other dynamic languages to see what RPython can do for them.<br>
<br>
This release supports:<br>
<ul>
<li>x86 machines on most common operating systems except Windows </li>
<li>newer ARM hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux </li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of PPC64 running Linux </li>
<li>s390x running Linux</li>
</ul>
Please try it out and let us know what you think. We welcome feedback, we know<br>
you are using PyPy, please tell us about it!<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>
