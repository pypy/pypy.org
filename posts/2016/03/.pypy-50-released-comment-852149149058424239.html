<html><body><p>What happened to the speed graph on speed.pypy.org? The speedups for earlier versions of PyPy before 5.0 suddenly are much higher than they used to be. Compare for example against the graph of a couple of weeks ago (https://web.archive.org/web/20160228102615/https://speed.pypy.org/)<br><br>Version   28/2   11/3<br>1.5       3.18x  4.86x<br>2.1       6.12x  7.50x<br>2.4.0     6.22x  7.61x<br>2.6.1     7.05x  8.58x<br><br>Has the benchmark been changed, the timing method, the speed computation, hardware used, etc? More importantly, which version is "correct"?<br></p></body></html>
