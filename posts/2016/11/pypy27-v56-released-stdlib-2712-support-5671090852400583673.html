We have released PyPy2.7 v5.6 [0], about two months after PyPy2.7 v5.4. This new PyPy2.7 release includes the upstream stdlib version 2.7.12.<br>
<br>
We continue to make incremental improvements to our C-API compatibility layer (cpyext). We pass all but 12 of the over-6000 tests in the upstream NumPy test suite, and have begun examining what it would take to support Pandas and PyQt. <br>
<br>
Work proceeds at a good pace on the PyPy3.5 version due to a <a class="reference external" href="/posts/2016/08/pypy-gets-funding-from-mozilla-for-5569307998787871200.html">grant</a> from the Mozilla Foundation, and some of those changes have been backported to PyPy2.7 where relevant.<br>
<br>
The PowerPC and s390x backend have been <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.co.at/2016/11/vectorization-extended-powerpc-and-s390x.html">enhanced</a> with the capability to use SIMD instructions for <span>micronumpy</span> loops.<br>
<br>
We changed <span><span style="font-size: small;"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">timeit</span></code></span> </span>to now report average +/- standard deviation, which is better than the misleading minimum value reported in CPython.<br>
<br>
We now support building PyPy with OpenSSL 1.1 in our built-in _ssl module, as well as maintaining support for previous versions.<br>
<br>
<a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatsnew.html">CFFI</a> has been updated to 1.9, improving an already great package for interfacing with C.<br>
<br>
As always, this release fixed many issues and bugs raised by the growing community of PyPy users. We strongly recommend updating. You can download the PyPy2.7 v5.6 release here:<br>

Downstream packagers have been hard at work. The Debian package is already available, and the <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/portable-pypy">portable PyPy</a> versions are also ready, for those who wish to run PyPy on other Linux distributions like RHEL/Centos 5.<br>
<br>
We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy project.<br>
<br>
We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html#make-more-python-modules-pypy-friendly">modules</a> to run on pypy, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython’s JIT even better.<br>

What is PyPy?</h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for CPython 2.7. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://pypyjs.org/">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython can do for them.<br>
This release supports:<br>
<blockquote>
<div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems (Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>newer <b>ARM</b> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux,</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <b>PPC64</b> running Linux,</li>
<li><b>s390x</b> running Linux</li>
</ul>
