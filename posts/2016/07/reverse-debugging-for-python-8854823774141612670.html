<h3>RevPDB<a href="#revpdb" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A "reverse debugger" is a debugger where you can go forward and
backward in time.  It is an uncommon feature, at least in the open
source world, but I have no idea why.  I have used <a class="reference external" href="https://undo.io/">undodb-gdb</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://rr-project.org/">rr</a>, which are reverse debuggers for C code, and I can only say that
they saved me many, many days of poking around blindly in gdb.</p>
<p>The PyPy team is pleased to give you "RevPDB", a reverse-debugger
similar to <tt class="docutils literal">rr</tt> but for Python.</p>
<p>An example is worth a thousand words.  Let's say your big Python
program has a bug that shows up inconsistently.  You have nailed it
down to something like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>start <tt class="docutils literal">x.py</tt>, which does stuff (maybe involving processing files,
answering some web requests that you simulate from another terminal,
etc.);</li>
<li>sometimes, after a few minutes, your program's state becomes
inconsistent and you get a failing assert or another exception.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the case where RevPDB is useful.</p>
<p>RevPDB is available only on 64-bit Linux and OS/X right now, but should
not be too hard to port to other OSes.  It is very much <em>alpha-level!</em>
(It is a debugger full of bugs.  Sorry about that.)  I believe it is
still useful---it helped me in one <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/bd220c268bc9">real use case</a> already.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-get-revpdb">
<h3>How to get RevPDB<a href="#how-to-get-revpdb" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following demo was done with an alpha version for 64-bit Linux,
compiled for Arch Linux.  I won't provide the binary; it should be
easy enough to retranslate (much faster than a regular PyPy because it
contains neither a JIT nor a custom GC).  Grab the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/download.html#building-from-source">PyPy sources</a> from
Mercurial, and then:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
hg update reverse-debugger
# or "hg update ff376ccacb36" for exactly this demo
cd pypy/goal
../../rpython/bin/rpython -O2 --revdb targetpypystandalone.py  \
                  --withoutmod-cpyext --withoutmod-micronumpy
</pre>
<p>and possibly rename the final <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-c</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> to avoid
confusion.</p>
<p>Other platforms than 64-bit Linux and OS/X need some fixes before they work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="demo">
<h3>Demo<a href="#demo" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>For this demo, we're going to use this <tt class="docutils literal">x.py</tt> as the "big program":</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import os

class Foo(object):
    value = 5

lst1 = [Foo() for i in range(100)]
lst1[50].value += 1
for x in lst1:
    x.value += 1

for x in lst1:
    if x.value != 6:
        print 'oops!'
        os._exit(1)
</pre>
<p>Of course, it is clear what occurs in this small example: the check
fails on item 50.  For this demo, the check has been written with
<tt class="docutils literal">os._exit(1)</tt>, because this exits immediately the program.  If it
was written with an <tt class="docutils literal">assert</tt>, then its failure would execute things
in the <tt class="docutils literal">traceback</tt> module afterwards, to print the traceback; it
would be a minor mess just to find the exact point of the failing
<tt class="docutils literal">assert</tt>.  (This and other issues are supposed to be fixed in the
future, but for now it is alpha-level.)</p>
<p>Anyway, with a regular <tt class="docutils literal">assert</tt> and a regular post-mortem <tt class="docutils literal">pdb</tt>,
we could observe that <tt class="docutils literal">x.value</tt> is indeed 7 instead of 6 when the
assert fails.  Imagine that the program is much bigger: how would we
find the exact chain of events that caused this value 7 to show up on
this particular <tt class="docutils literal">Foo</tt> object?  This is what RevPDB is for.</p>
<p><strike>First, we need for now to disable Address Space Layout Randomization
(ASLR), otherwise replaying will not work.  This is done once with the
following command line, which changes the state until the next
reboot:</strike></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
</pre>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> the above is no longer necessary from revision ff376ccacb36.</p>
<p>Run <tt class="docutils literal">x.py</tt> with RevPDB's version of PyPy instead of the regular
interpreter (CPython or PyPy):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
PYPYRDB=log.rdb ./pypy-revdb x.py
</pre>
<p>This <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> executable is like a slow PyPy executable, running
(for now) without a JIT.  This produces a file <tt class="docutils literal">log.rdb</tt> which
contains a complete log of this execution.  (If the bug we are
tracking occurs rarely, we need to re-run it several times until we
get the failure.  But once we got the failure, then we're done with
this step.)</p>
<p>Start:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rpython/translator/revdb/revdb.py log.rdb
</pre>
<p>We get a pdb-style debugger.  This <tt class="docutils literal">revdb.py</tt> is a normal Python
program, which you run with an unmodified Python; internally, it looks
inside the log for the path to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> and run it as needed (as
one forking subprocess, in a special mode).</p>
<p>Initially, we are at the start of the program---not at the end, like
we'd get in a regular debugger:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
File "&lt;builtin&gt;/app_main.py", line 787 in setup_bootstrap_path:
(1)$
</pre>
<p>The list of commands is available with <tt class="docutils literal">help</tt>.</p>
<p>Go to the end with <tt class="docutils literal">continue</tt> (or <tt class="docutils literal">c</tt>):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(1)$ continue
File "/tmp/x.py", line 14 in &lt;module&gt;:
...
  lst1 = [Foo() for i in range(100)]
  lst1[50].value += 1
  for x in lst1:
      x.value += 1

  for x in lst1:
      if x.value != 6:
          print 'oops!'
&gt;         os._exit(1)
(19727)$
</pre>
<p>We are now at the beginning of the last executed line.  The number
19727 is the "time", measured in number of lines executed.  We can go
backward with the <tt class="docutils literal">bstep</tt> command (backward step, or <tt class="docutils literal">bs</tt>), line
by line, and forward again with the <tt class="docutils literal">step</tt> command.  There are also
commands <tt class="docutils literal">bnext</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">bcontinue</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">bfinish</tt> and their forward
equivalents.  There is also "<tt class="docutils literal">go TIME</tt>" to jump directly to the specified
time.  (Right now the debugger only stops at "line start"
events, not at function entry or exit, which makes some cases a bit
surprising: for example, a <tt class="docutils literal">step</tt> from the return statement of
function <tt class="docutils literal">foo()</tt> will jump directly to the caller's caller, if the
caller's current line was <tt class="docutils literal">return foo() + 2</tt>, because no "line
start" event occurs in the caller after <tt class="docutils literal">foo()</tt> returns to it.)</p>
<p>We can print Python expressions and statements using the <tt class="docutils literal">p</tt>
command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(19727)$ p x
$0 = &lt;__main__.Foo object at 0xfffffffffffeab3e&gt;
(19727)$ p x.value
$1 = 7
(19727)$ p x.value + 1
8
</pre>
<p>The "<tt class="docutils literal">$NUM =</tt>" prefix is only shown when we print an object that
really exists in the debugged program; that's why the last line does
not contain it.  Once a <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM</tt> has been printed, then we can use
it in further expressions---even at a different point time.  It
becomes an anchor that always refers to the same object:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(19727)$ bstep

File "/tmp/x.py", line 13 in &lt;module&gt;:
...

  lst1 = [Foo() for i in range(100)]
  lst1[50].value += 1
  for x in lst1:
      x.value += 1

  for x in lst1:
      if x.value != 6:
&gt;         print 'oops!'
          os._exit(1)
(19726)$ p $0.value
$1 = 7
</pre>
<p>In this case, we want to know when this value 7 was put in this
attribute.  This is the job of a watchpoint:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(19726)$ watch $0.value
Watchpoint 1 added
updating watchpoint value: $0.value =&gt; 7
</pre>
<p>This watchpoint means that <tt class="docutils literal">$0.value</tt> will be evaluated at each line.
When the <tt class="docutils literal">repr()</tt> of this expression changes, the watchpoint activates
and execution stops:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(19726)$ bcontinue

File "/tmp/x.py", line 9 in &lt;module&gt;:
  import os

  class Foo(object):
      value = 5

  lst1 = [Foo() for i in range(100)]
  lst1[50].value += 1
  for x in lst1:
&gt;     x.value += 1

  for x in lst1:
      if x.value != 6:
          print 'oops!'
          os._exit(1)
(19524)$
</pre>
<p>Note that using the <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM</tt> syntax is essential in watchpoints.  You
can't say "<tt class="docutils literal">watch x.value</tt>", because the variable <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> will go out
of scope very soon when we move forward or backward in time.  In fact
the watchpoint expression is always evaluated inside an environment
that contains the builtins but not the current locals and globals.
But it also contains all the <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM</tt>, which can be used to refer to
known objects.  It is thus common to watch <tt class="docutils literal">$0.attribute</tt> if <tt class="docutils literal">$0</tt>
is an object, or to watch <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">len($1)</span></tt> if <tt class="docutils literal">$1</tt> is some list.  The
watch expression can also be a simple boolean: for example, "<tt class="docutils literal">watch
$2 in $3</tt>" where <tt class="docutils literal">$3</tt> is some dict and <tt class="docutils literal">$2</tt> is some object that
you find now in the dict; you would use this to find out the time when
<tt class="docutils literal">$2</tt> was put inside <tt class="docutils literal">$3</tt>, or removed from it.</p>
<p>Use "<tt class="docutils literal">info watchpoints</tt>" and "<tt class="docutils literal">delete &lt;watchpointnum&gt;</tt>" to manage
watchpoints.</p>
<p>There are also regular breakpoints, which you set with "<tt class="docutils literal">b
FUNCNAME</tt>".  It breaks whenever there is a call to a function that
happens to have the given name.  (It might be annoying to use for a
function like <tt class="docutils literal">__init__()</tt> which has many homonyms.  There is no
support for breaking on a fully-qualified name or at a given line
number for now.)</p>
<p>In our demo, we stop at the line <tt class="docutils literal">x.value += 1</tt>, which is where the
value was changed from 6 to 7.  Use <tt class="docutils literal">bcontinue</tt> again to stop at the
line <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lst1[50].value</span> += 1</tt>, which is where the value was changed from
5 to 6.  Now we know how this <tt class="docutils literal">value</tt> attribute ends up being 7.</p>

an object that does not exist yet, so the watchpoint now evaluates to
an error message (but it continues to work as before, with that error
message as the string it currently evaluates to).</p>

<p>In big programs, the workflow is similar, just more complex.  Usually
it works this way: we find interesting points in time with some
combination of watchpoints and some direct commands to move around.
We write down on a piece of (real or virtual) paper these points in
history, including most importantly their time, so that we can
construct an ordered understanding of what is going on.</p>
<p>The current <tt class="docutils literal">revdb</tt> can be annoying and sometimes even crash; but
the history you reconstruct can be kept.  All the times and
expressions printed are still valid when you restart <tt class="docutils literal">revdb</tt>.  The
only thing "lost" is the <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM</tt> objects, which you need to print
again.  (Maybe instead of <tt class="docutils literal">$0</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">$1</tt>, ...  we should use <tt class="docutils literal">$&lt;big
number&gt;</tt>, where the big number identifies uniquely the object by its
creation time.  These numbers would continue to be valid even after
<tt class="docutils literal">revdb</tt> is restarted.  They are more annoying to use than just
<tt class="docutils literal">$0</tt> though.)</p>

<li>Does not contain a JIT, and does not use our fast garbage
collectors.  You can expect <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> to be maybe 3 times
slower than CPython.</li>
<li>Only works on Linux and OS/X.  There is no fundamental reason for
this restriction, but it is some work to fix.</li>
<li>Replaying a program uses a <em>lot</em> more memory; maybe 15x as much than
during the recording.  This is because it creates many forks.  If
you have a program that consumes 10% of your RAM or more, you will
need to reduce <tt class="docutils literal">MAX_SUBPROCESSES</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">process.py</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Replaying also comes with a bunch of user interface issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">Attempted to do I/O or access raw memory</tt>: we get this whenever
trying to <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> some expression that cannot be evaluated with
only the GC memory---or which can, but then the <tt class="docutils literal">__repr__()</tt>
method of the result cannot.  We need to reset the state with
<tt class="docutils literal">bstep</tt> + <tt class="docutils literal">step</tt> before we can print anything else.  However,
if only the <tt class="docutils literal">__repr__()</tt> crashes, you still see the <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM =</tt>
prefix, and you can use that <tt class="docutils literal">$NUM</tt> afterwards.</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">id()</tt> is globally unique, returning a reproducible 64-bit number,
so sometimes using <tt class="docutils literal">id(x)</tt> is a workaround for when using <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>
doesn't work because of <tt class="docutils literal">Attempted to do I/O</tt> issues (e.g.  <tt class="docutils literal">p
[id(x) for x in somelist]</tt>).</li>
<li>as explained in the demo, next/bnext/finish/bfinish might jump
around a bit non-predictably.</li>
<li>similarly, breaks on watchpoints can stop at apparently unexpected
places (when going backward, try to do "step" once).  The issue is
that it can only stop at the beginning of every line.  In the
extreme example, if a line is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo(somelist.pop(getindex()))</span></tt>,
then <tt class="docutils literal">somelist</tt> is modified in the middle.  Immediately before
this modification occurs, we are in <tt class="docutils literal">getindex()</tt>, and
immediately afterwards we are in <tt class="docutils literal">foo()</tt>.  The watchpoint will
stop the program at the end of <tt class="docutils literal">getindex()</tt> if running backward,
and at the start of <tt class="docutils literal">foo()</tt> if running forward, but never
actually on the line doing the change.</li>
<li>watchpoint expressions <em>must not</em> have any side-effect at all.  If
they do, the replaying will get out of sync and <tt class="docutils literal">revdb.py</tt> will
complain about that.  Regular <tt class="docutils literal">p</tt> expressions and statements can
have side-effects; these effects are discarded as soon as you move
in time again.</li>
<li>sometimes even "<tt class="docutils literal">p import foo</tt>" will fail with <tt class="docutils literal">Attempted to do
I/O</tt>.  Use instead "<tt class="docutils literal">p import sys; foo = <span class="pre">sys.modules['foo']</span></tt>".</li>
<li>use <tt class="docutils literal">help</tt> to see all commands.  <tt class="docutils literal">backtrace</tt> can be useful.
There is no <tt class="docutils literal">up</tt> command; you have to move in time instead,
e.g. using <tt class="docutils literal">bfinish</tt> to go back to the point where the current
function was called.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How RevPDB is done<a href="#how-revpdb-is-done" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If I had to pick the main advantage of PyPy over CPython, it is that
we have got with the RPython translation toolchain a real place for
experimentation.  Every now and then, we build inside RPython some
feature that gives us an optionally tweaked version of the PyPy
interpreter---tweaked in a way that would be hard to do with CPython,
because it would require systematic changes everywhere.  The most
obvious and successful examples are the GC and the JIT.  But there
have been many other experiments along the same lines, from the
so-called <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/extradoc/-/blob/branch/default/tip/eu-report/D07.1_Massive_Parallelism_and_Translation_Aspects-2007-02-28.pdf">stackless transformation</a> in the early days, to the STM
version of PyPy.</p>
<p>RevPDB works in a similar way.  It is a version of PyPy in which some
operations are systematically replaced with other operations.</p>
<p>To keep the log file at a reasonable size, we duplicate the content of
all GC objects during replaying---by repeating the same actions on
them, without writing anything in the log file.  So that means that in
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy-revdb</span></tt> binary, the operations that do arithmetic or
read/write GC-managed memory are not modified.  Most operations are
like that.  However, the other operations, the ones that involve
either non-GC memory or calls to external C functions, are tweaked.
Each of these operations is replaced with code that works in two
modes, based on a global flag:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>in "recording" mode, we log the result of the operation (but not the
arguments);</li>
<li>in "replaying" mode, we don't really do the operation at all, but
instead just fetch the result from the log.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, all remaining unmodified operations (arithmetic and GC
load/store) are completely deterministic.  So during replaying, every
integer or non-GC pointer variable will have exactly the same value as
it had during recording.  Interestingly, it means that if the
recording process had a big array in non-GC memory, then in the
replaying process, the array is not allocated at all; it is just
represented by the same address, but there is nothing there.  When we
record "read item 123 from the array", we record the result of the
read (but not the "123").  When we replay, we're seeing again the same
"read item 123 from the array" operation.  At that point, we don't
read anything; we just return the result from the log.  Similarly,
when recording a "write" to the array, we record nothing (this write
operation has no result); so that when replaying, we redo nothing.</p>
<p>Note how that differs from anything managed by GC memory: GC objects
(including GC arrays) are really allocated, writes really occur, and
reads are redone.  We don't touch the log in this case.</p>

<div class="section" id="other-reverse-debuggers-for-python">
<h3>Other reverse debuggers for Python<a href="#other-reverse-debuggers-for-python" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are already some Python experiments about <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger#Reverse_debugging">reverse debugging</a>.
This is also known as "omniscient debugging".  However, I claim that
the result they get to is not very useful (for the purpose presented
here).  How they work is typically by recording changes to some
objects, like lists and dictionaries, in addition to recording the
history of where your program passed through.  However, the problem of
Python is that lists and dictionaries are not the end of the story.
There are many, many, many types of objects written in C which are
mutable---in fact, the immutable ones are the exception.  You can try
to systematically record all changes, but it is a huge task and easy
to forget a detail.</p>
<p>In other words it is a typical use case for tweaking the RPython
translation toolchain, rather than tweaking the CPython (or PyPy)
interpreter directly.  The result that we get here with RevPDB is more
similar to <a class="reference external" href="https://rr-project.org/">rr</a> anyway, in that only a relatively small number of
external events are recorded---not every single change to every single
list and dictionary.</p>

<h3>Future work<a href="#future-work" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, it is alpha-level, and only works on Linux and OS/X.
So the plans for the immediate future are to fix the various
issues described above, and port to more operating systems.  The core of the system
is in the C file and headers in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rpython/translator/revdb/src-revdb</span></tt>.</p>
<p>For interested people, there is also the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/duhton/">Duhton</a> interpreter and its
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reverse-debugger</span></tt> branch, which is where I prototyped the RPython
concept before moving to PyPy.  The basics should work for any
interpreter written in RPython, but they require some specific code to
interface with the language; in the case of PyPy, it is in
<tt class="docutils literal">pypy/interpreter/reverse_debugging.py</tt>.</p>
<p>In parallel, there are various user interface improvements that people
could be interested in, like a more "pdb++" experience.  (And the script
at <tt class="docutils literal">rpython/translator/revdb/revdb.py</tt> should be moved out into some
more "official" place, and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reverse-debugger</span></tt> branch should be
merged back to default.)</p>
<p>I would certainly welcome any help!</p>
