<html><body><h2>PyPy Leysin Winter Sprint (14-21th April 2009)</h2>

<p>The next PyPy sprint will be in Leysin, Switzerland, for the
sixth time.  This sprint will take place immediately after
Easter.  This is a fully public sprint: newcomers and topics
other than those proposed below are welcome.</p>

<ul>
<li>The overall idea of the sprint is to continue working on making PyPy ready
for general use.  There are a few tasks left in there.  In parallel, we
will continue the work on the JIT, if there is general interest.  And as
usual, we are ready to add any other task -- please mention on the mailing
list what you would like to work on; the list of task is not really fixed.</li>
<li>And as usual, the main side goal is to have fun in winter sports :-)
We can take a day off for ski until Sunday, the 19th; afterwards, the
installations close.  (There was quite a lot of snow this winter, so
there should be some left even though it's relatively late in the season.)</li>
</ul>
