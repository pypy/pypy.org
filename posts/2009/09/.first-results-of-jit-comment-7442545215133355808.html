<html><body><p>Here are prebuilt C sources (in which "tracing" time was reduced by 20-30% since the blog post):<br><br>https://wyvern.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/~arigo/chain.tar.bz2<br><br>Linux x86-32 only.  You still need a svn checkout of PyPy, and you still need to compile them with gcc -- but it does not take too long: edit the first entry of the Makefile to point to your checkout of PyPy and type "make".  This still assumes that all dependencies have been installed first.  Don't complain if the #includes are at the wrong location for your distribution; you would get them right if you translated the whole thing yourself.  In fact, don't complain if it does not compile for any reason, please :-)  C sources like that are not really supposed to be portable, because they are just intermediates in the translation process.</p></body></html>
