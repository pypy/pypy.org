Hello.
</p>

<p>
We've just merged branch which adds float support to x86 backend.
This means that floating point operations are now super fast
in PyPy's JIT. Let's have a look at example, provided by 
<a href="https://lazypython.blogspot.com/">Alex Gaynor</a>
and stolen from <a href="https://factor-language.blogspot.com/2009/08/performance-comparison-between-factor.html">Factor blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
The original version of the <a href="https://paste.pocoo.org/raw/142952/">benchmark</a>, was definitely tuned for the performance needs of CPython.
</p><p>
For running this on PyPy, I changed to a bit <a href="https://paste.pocoo.org/show/143243/">simpler version of the program</a>,
and I'll explain a few changes that I did, which the reflect current
limitations of PyPy's JIT. They're not very deep and they might be
already gone while you're reading it:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Usage of <tt>__slots__</tt>. This is a bit ridiculous, but we spend quite a bit
  of time to speed up normal instances of new-style classes which are
  very fast, yet ones with <tt>__slots__</tt> are slower. To be fixed soon.</li>

<li>Usage of reduce. This one is even more obscure, but reduce is not
  perceived as a thing producing loops in a program. Moving to
  a pure-Python version of reduce fixes the problem.</li>

<li>Using <tt>x ** 2</tt> vs <tt>x * x</tt>. In PyPy, reading a local variable is a
  no-op when JITted (the same as reading local variable in C). However
  multiplication is simpler operation that power operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I also included the original <a href="https://paste.factorcode.org/paste?id=838">Java benchmark</a>. Please
note that original java version is similar to my modified one
(not the one specifically tuned for CPython)
</p>

The performance figures below (for <tt>n = 1 000 000</tt>), average of 10 runs:

<ul>
<li>CPython 2.6: <b>7.56s</b></li>
<li>CPython &amp; psyco 2.6: <b>4.44s</b></li>
<li>PyPy: <b>1.63s</b></li>
<li>Java (JVM 1.6, client mode): <b>0.77s</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
and while JVM is much faster, it's very good that we can even compare :-)
