<html><body><p>@kitblake good point.  The main blocker for making PyPy useful on mobile phones is support for GUI apps.  Alexander's recent <a href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2009/11/using-cpython-extension-modules-with.html" rel="nofollow">PyPy QT experiments</a> are teasing in this direction. To fully exploit PyPy's super-efficient memory usage we probably  need to provide native bindings. That and maybe a GIL-less interpreter would make PyPy a superior choice for mobile devices.  <br><br>However, GUI-bindings/free threading are orthogonal to the ongoing JIT-efforts. Somehow PyPy suffers a bit from its big potential (there also is stackless and sandboxing etc.). Question is: (How) can we make donation/other funding guide PyPy developments and at the same time support dedicated developers?</p></body></html>
