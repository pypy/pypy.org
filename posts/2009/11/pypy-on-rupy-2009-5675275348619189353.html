<html><body><p>Hello.
</p><p>
It's maybe a bit late to announce, but there will be PyPy talk
at <a href="https://rupy.eu">Rupy</a> conference this weekend in
Poznan. Precisely, I'll be talking mostly about PyPy's JIT and
how to use it. Unfortunately the talk is on Saturday, at 8:30 in the morning.
</p>
<p>
<b>EDIT:</b> Talk is <a href="https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/rupy2009">online</a>, together with examples
</p>
Cheers,<br>
