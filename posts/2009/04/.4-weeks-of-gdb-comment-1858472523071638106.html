<html><body><p>Good day.<br>I use Python for about 3 years and i am following your blog almost every day to see news.<br>I am very excited to see more Pypy, though i don't understand how to use it (?!?!) and i never managed to install it!<br>Wikipedia says "PyPy is a followup to the Psyco project" and i use Psyco, so Pypy must be a very good thing. I use Psyco very intense, in all my applications, but it's very easy to use.<br>I have Windows and Windows document is incomplete "https://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/windows.html". I have MinGW compiler.<br>Pypy is not very friendly with users. I think more help documents would be very useful. When i will understand how to install Pypy, i will use it.<br>Keep up the good work!</p></body></html>
