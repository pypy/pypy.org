<html><body><p>Finally, we managed to squeeze in some time to write a report about what
has been going on the mysterious JIT sprint in Gothenburg, Sweden.
The main goals of the sprint were to lay down the groundwork for getting
more JIT work going in the next months and get more of PyPy developers
up to speed with the current state of the JIT. One of the elements was
to get better stability of the JIT, moving it slowly from being a prototype to
actually work nicely on larger programs.</p>

<p>The secret goal of the sprint was to seek more speed, which Anto and
Carl Friedrich did even during the break day:</p>

<p>We spent the first two days improving test coverage of the x86 backend
and the optimizer. Now we have 100% coverage with unittests
(modulo figleaf bugs), which does not mean anything, but it's better
than before.</p>

<p>Then we spent quite some time improving the optimizer passes, so
now we generate far less code than before the sprint, because a lot of
it is optimized away. On the interpreter side, we marked more objects
(like code objects) as immutable, so that reading fields from them
can be constant-folded.</p>
<p>Another important optimization that we did is to remove consecutive
reading of the same fields from the same structure, if no code in between
can change it.</p>
<p>Our JIT is a hybrid environment, where only hot loops of code are jitted
and the rest stays being interpreted. We found out that the performance
of the non-jitted part was suboptimal, because all accesses to python
frames went through an extra layer of indirection. We removed this layer
of indirection, in the case where the jit and the interpreter cannot
access the same frame (which is the common case).</p>
<p>We also spent some time improving the performance of our x86 backend,
by making it use more registers and by doing more advanced variable
renaming at the end of loops. It seems that using more registerd is not as
much of a win as we hoped, because modern day processors are much
smarter than we thought.</p>
<p>The most mind bending part was finding why we loose performance by
making the JIT see more of the interpreter. It took us two very frustrating
days and 36 gray hairs to find out that from the JIT we call a different malloc
function in the Boehm GC, which is by far slower than the version that
we use from the interpreter. This meant that the more we jitted, the
slower our code got, purely because of the mallocs.</p>
<p>Now that this is fixed, the world makes much more sense again.</p>
<p>A lot of the sprint's work is not directly measurable in the performance
figures, but we did a lot of work that is necessary for performance to
improve in the next weeks. After we have done a bit more work, we should
be able to provide some performance figures for programs that are
more realistic than just loops that count to ten millions (which are
very fast already :).</p>
<p>Now we're going to enjoy a couple of days off to recover from the sprint.</p>
