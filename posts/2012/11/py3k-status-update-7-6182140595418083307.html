<html><body><p>This is the seventh status update about our work on the <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/tree/branch/py3k">py3k branch</a>, which<br>
we can work on thanks to all of the people who <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/01/py3k-and-numpy-first-stage-thanks-to.html">donated</a> to the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/py3donate.html">py3k<br>
proposal</a>.</p><p>The biggest news is that this month Philip started to work on py3k in parallel<br>
to Antonio. As such, there was an increased amount of activity.</p><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/summary?branch=py3k">py3k buildbots</a> now fully translate the branch every night and run the<br>
Python standard library tests.</p><p>We currently pass 160 out of approximately 355 modules of CPython's standard<br>
test suite, fail 144 and skip approximately 51.</p><p>Some highlights:</p><ul class="simple"><li>dictviews (the objects returned by dict.keys/values/items) has been greatly<br>
improved, and now they full support set operators</li>
<li>a lot of tests has been fixed wrt complex numbers (and in particular the<br>
<tt class="docutils literal">__complex__</tt> method)</li>
<li>_csv has been fixed and now it correctly handles unicode instead of bytes</li>
<li>more parser fixes, py3k list comprehension semantics; now you can no longer<br>
access the list comprehension variable after it finishes</li>
<li>2to3'd most of the lib_pypy modules (pypy's custom standard lib<br>
replacements/additions)</li>
<li>py3-enabled pyrepl: this means that finally readline works at the command<br>
prompt, as well as builtins.input(). <tt class="docutils literal">pdb</tt> seems to work, as well as<br>
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fancycompleter">fancycompleter</a> to get colorful TAB completions :-)</li>
<li>py3 round</li>
<li>further tightening/cleanup of the unicode handling (more usage of<br>
surrogateescape, surrogatepass among other things)</li>
<li>as well as keeping up with some big changes happening on the default branch<br>
and of course various other fixes.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, we would like to thank Amaury Forgeot d'Arc for his significant<br>
contributions.</p><p>cheers,<br>
Philip&amp;Antonio</p></body></html>
