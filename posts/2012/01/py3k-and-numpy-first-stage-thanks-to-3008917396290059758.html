<html><body><p>Last year was quite successful for PyPy fundraising through the <a class="reference external" href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>, and Conservancy and PyPy are very excited to announce that enough was raised to begin the first stages on the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/py3donate.html">Py3k</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/numpydonate.html">Numpy</a> grant proposals.</p><p>As of the end of 2011, 135 different individuals gave to the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/py3donate.html">Py3k</a> campaign, and 114 to the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/numpydonate.html">Numpy</a> campaign.  We thank each of you who donated to help make this work possible.  Meanwhile, if you haven't given to support these projects, we do hope you'll give generously now to help fund their second stages later this year!</p><p>We're also particularly excited that a few donors gave particularly large donations to support this work; those big donations really filled in the gap to help us get started!</p><p>Specifically, we're pleased to announce that <a class="reference external" href="https://google.com">Google</a>  donated $35000 towards implementing Python 3 in PyPy.   Google's general support of the Python community is well known, and their specific support of our grant proposal is much appreciated.</p><p>Meanwhile, Numpy was supported in part by contributions from Nate Lawson, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cantabcapital.com/">Cantab Capital Partners</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.getcollc.com/">Getco</a>, as well as more than a hundred other contributors.</p><p>With these donations combined with many others, we're now starting work on both projects.  This week, the <a class="reference external" href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Conservancy</a> signed contracts with <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/#!/antocuni">Antonio Cuni</a> and Benjamin Peterson to work towards the Stage 1.1 goals in Py3k proposal (and is negotiating for another contractor as well), and with <a class="reference external" href="https://baroquesoftware.com/~fijal/">Maciej Fijałkowski</a> to work towards the Stage 1 goals in the Numpy proposal.</p><p>In 2012, PyPy will continue regular <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/12/leysin-winter-sprint.html">sprint meetings</a>, at which Py3K and Numpy efforts will certainly have a place.  We have some limited funds to fund travels of contributors to those meetings.</p><p>We're very thankful for all who donated so far to support these efforts, and we hope that now that work has begun, even more donors will come forward to help us finish the job.  In the meantime, watch for the commits showing up from these developers and other contributors in the PyPy repositories!</p><p>Cheers, The PyPy Team</p></body></html>
