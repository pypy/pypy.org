<html><body><p>Hello, everyone</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that there is a very interesting opportunity
for doing an internship at <a class="reference external" href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/">NCAR</a> in the lovely town of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado">Boulder</a>, situated
on the foothils of Rocky Mountains. Before you read on, make sure you:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>are a student of a US University, who is legally eligible to work in the US</li>
<li>are at least finishing second year this year</li>
<li>apply before February 3rd.</li>
</ul>
<p>The internship itself will focus on using PyPy (in some way) to provide
a high performance numeric kernel for an atmospheric model, and measuring how
fast we can go. This is very much in line with what the current effort on
NumPy in PyPy is about. The internship will be mentored by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/delvento">Davide del Vento</a>
and I hope to have some influence over where it goes myself :-)</p>

<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/siparcs/opportunities/ad">internship proposal</a> - note that the actual roadmap is very flexible, as
long as it's a numeric kernel of an atmospheric model using PyPy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to contact Davide for details about the proposal and <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">pypy-dev</a> or
me directly for details about PyPy.</p>
