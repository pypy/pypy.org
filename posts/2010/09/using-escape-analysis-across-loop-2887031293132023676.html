      <p>This blog post is a successor to the one about <a class="reference external" href="escape-analysis-in-pypys-jit-1780048403046080197.html">escape analysis in PyPy's
JIT</a>. The examples from there will be continued here. This post is a bit
science-fictiony. The algorithm that PyPy currently uses is significantly more
complex and much harder than the one that is described here. The resulting
behaviour is very similar, however, so we will use the simpler version (and we
might switch to that at some point in the actual implementation).</p>
<p>In the last blog post we described how escape analysis can be used to remove
many of the allocations of short-lived objects and many of the type dispatches
that are present in a non-optimized trace. In this post we will improve the
optimization to also handle more cases.</p>
<p>To understand some more what the optimization described in the last blog post
can achieve, look at the following figure:</p>
<p>

<img alt="new lifetimes" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TJohiRZtjZI/AAAAAAAAALs/Tns2pB_gVPY/s1600/obj-lifetime.png"></p>
<p>The figure shows a trace before optimization, together with the lifetime of
various kinds of objects created in the trace. It is executed from top to
bottom. At the bottom, a jump is used to execute the same loop another time.
For clarity, the figure shows two iterations of the loop.
The loop is executed until one of the guards in the trace fails, and the
execution is aborted.</p>
<p>Some of the operations within this trace are <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> operations, which each create a
new instance of some class. These instances are used for a while, e.g. by
calling methods on them, reading and writing their fields. Some of these
instances escape, which means that they are stored in some globally accessible
place or are passed into a function.</p>
<p>Together with the <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> operations, the figure shows the lifetimes of the
created objects. Objects in category 1 live for a while, and are then just not
used any more. The creation of these objects is removed by the
optimization described in the last blog post.</p>
<p>Objects in category 2 live for a while and then escape. The optimization of the
last post deals with them too: the <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> that creates them and
the field accesses are deferred, until the point where the object escapes.</p>
<p>The objects in category 3 and 4 are in principle like the objects in category 1
and 2. They are created, live for a while, but are then passed as an argument
to the <tt class="docutils literal">jump</tt> operation. In the next iteration they can either die (category
3) or escape (category 4).</p>
<p>The optimization of the last post considered the passing of an object along a
jump to be equivalent to escaping. It was thus treating objects in category 3
and 4 like those in category 2.</p>
<p>The improved optimization described in this post will make it possible to deal
better with objects in category 3 and 4. This will have two consequences: on
the one hand, more allocations are removed from the trace (which is clearly
good). As a side-effect of this, the traces will also be type-specialized.</p>
<div class="section" id="optimizing-across-the-jump">
<h2>Optimizing Across the Jump<a href="#optimizing-across-the-jump" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let's look at the final trace obtained in the last post for the example loop.
The final trace was much better than the original one, because many allocations
were removed from it. However, it also still contained allocations:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="step 1" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TJoiO1zH8II/AAAAAAAAAL0/N2CSp4EnMAw/s1600/step1.png">
</div>
<p>The two new <tt class="docutils literal">BoxedIntegers</tt> stored in <tt class="docutils literal">p15</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">p10</tt> are passed into
the next iteration of the loop. The next iteration will check that they are
indeed <tt class="docutils literal">BoxedIntegers</tt>, read their <tt class="docutils literal">intval</tt> fields and then not use them
any more. Thus those instances are in category 3.</p>
<p>In its current state the loop
allocates two <tt class="docutils literal">BoxedIntegers</tt> at the end of every iteration, that then die
very quickly in the next iteration. In addition, the type checks at the start
of the loop are superfluous, at least after the first iteration.</p>
<p>The reason why we cannot optimize the remaining allocations away is because
their lifetime crosses the jump. To improve the situation, a little trick is
needed. The trace above represents a loop, i.e. the jump at the end jumps to
the beginning. Where in the loop the jump occurs is arbitrary, since the loop
can only be left via failing guards anyway. Therefore it does not change the
semantics of the loop to put the jump at another point into the trace and we
can move the <tt class="docutils literal">jump</tt> operation just above the allocation of the objects that
appear in the current <tt class="docutils literal">jump</tt>. This needs some care, because the arguments to
<tt class="docutils literal">jump</tt> are all currently live variables, thus they need to be adapted.</p>
<p>If we do that for our example trace above, the trace looks like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="step 2" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TJoiPTYjwgI/AAAAAAAAAL8/X7RrjkpzKwc/s1600/step2.png">
</div>
<p>Now the lifetime of the remaining allocations no longer crosses the jump, and
we can run our escape analysis a second time, to get the following trace:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="step3" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TJoiP8o9rNI/AAAAAAAAAME/XHA-nsDB1kI/s1600/step3.png">
</div>
<p>This result is now really good. The code performs the same operations than
the original code, but using direct CPU arithmetic and no boxing, as opposed to
the original version which used dynamic dispatching and boxing.</p>
<p>Looking at the final trace it is also completely clear that specialization has
happened. The trace corresponds to the situation in which the trace was
originally recorded, which happened to be a loop where <tt class="docutils literal">BoxedIntegers</tt> were
used. The now resulting loop does not refer to the <tt class="docutils literal">BoxedInteger</tt> class at
all any more, but it still has the same behaviour. If the original loop had
used <tt class="docutils literal">BoxedFloats</tt>, the final loop would use <tt class="docutils literal">float_*</tt> operations
everywhere instead (or even be very different, if the object model had
user-defined classes).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="entering-the-loop">
<h2>Entering the Loop<a href="#entering-the-loop" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The approach of placing the <tt class="docutils literal">jump</tt> at some other point in the loop leads to
one additional complication that we glossed over so far. The beginning of the
original loop corresponds to a point in the original program, namely the
<tt class="docutils literal">while</tt> loop in the function <tt class="docutils literal">f</tt> from the last post.</p>
<p>Now recall that in a VM that uses a tracing JIT, all programs start by being
interpreted. This means that when <tt class="docutils literal">f</tt> is executed by the interpreter, it is
easy to go from the interpreter to the first version of the compiled loop.
After the <tt class="docutils literal">jump</tt> is moved and the escape analysis optimization is applied a
second time, this is no longer easily possible.  In particular, the new loop
expects two integers as input arguments, while the old one expected two
instances.</p>
<p>To make it possible to enter the loop directly from the intepreter, there
needs to be some additional code that enters the loop by taking as input
arguments what is available to the interpreter, i.e. two instances. This
additional code corresponds to one iteration of the loop, which is thus

<h2>Summary<a href="#summary" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The optimization described in this post can be used to optimize away
allocations in category 3 and improve allocations in category 4, by deferring
them until they are no longer avoidable. A side-effect of these optimizations
is also that the optimized loops are specialized for the types of the variables
that are used inside them.</p>
