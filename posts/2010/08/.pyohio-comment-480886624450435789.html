<html><body><p>The author of Luajit, Mike Pall, participated in a long thread posted here https://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3851#comment-57700 , as well as Maciej and others.<br><br>There, he said about python:<br>"Python (the core language) just has different quirks that need to be worked around. But no show stoppers.<br>What is more challenging, is to efficiently handle Python (the programming environment) with all of its classes and methods. In particular the plethora of container types, since you really want to inline their accessors.<br>Since I don't believe in multi-language VMs, LuaJIT is pretty Lua-specific on all levels. Your best bet right now is to join the PyPy effort (they already handle the issues I mentioned)."</p></body></html>
