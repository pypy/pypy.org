<html><body><p>A couple days have passed since the announcement of the 1.4 release, and this
is a short summary of what happened afterwards. Let's start with
numbers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>16k visits to the <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2010/11/pypy-14-ouroboros-in-practice.html">release announcement</a> on our blog</li>
<li>we don't have download statistics unfortunately</li>
<li>10k visits to <a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">speed center</a></li>
<li>most traffic comes from referring sites, reddit alone creating above a third
of our traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>Not too bad for a project that doesn't have a well-established user base.</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Releases are very important. They're still the major way projects communicate
with community, even if we have nightly builds that are mostly stable.</li>
<li>No segfaults were reported, no incompatibilities between JIT and normal
interpretation. We think that proves (or at least provides a lot of
experimental evidence) that our write-once-and-then-transform method is
effective.</li>
<li>A lot of people complained about their favorite module in C not working, we
should have made it clearer that CPyExt is in <strong>alpha</strong> state.  Indeed, we
would like to know which C extension modules <strong>do</strong> work :-).</li>
<li>Some people reported massive speedups, other reported slowdowns compared
to CPython. Most of those slowdowns relate to modules being inefficient
(or doing happy nonsense), like ctypes. This is expected, given that
not all modules are even jitted (although having them jitted is usually
a matter of a couple of minutes).</li>
<li>Nobody complained about a lack of some stdlib module. We implemented the ones
which are used more often, but this makes us wonder if less used stdlib modules
have any users at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and we would like to
thank everyone trying (and especially those reporting problems)</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
