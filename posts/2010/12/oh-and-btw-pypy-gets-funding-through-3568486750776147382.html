<html><body><p>There is a supporting reason why we made so many advances in the last year:
funding through <a class="reference" href="https://www.eurostars-eureka.eu/">Eurostars</a>, a European research funding program.
The title of our proposal (accepted in 2009) is: "PYJIT - a fast
and flexible toolkit for dynamic programming languages based on PyPy".
And the participants are <a class="reference" href="https://www.openend.se/">Open End AB</a>, the <a class="reference" href="https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/">Heinrich-Heine-Universität
Düsseldorf</a> (HHU), and <a class="reference" href="https://www.merlinux.de/">merlinux GmbH</a>.</p>
<p>It's not hard to guess what PYJIT is actually about, is it?
Quoting: "The PYJIT project will deliver a fast and flexible
Just-In-Time Compiler toolkit based on PyPy to the market of dynamic
languages.  Our main aim is to showcase our project's results for the
Open Source language Python, providing unprecedented levels of
flexibility and with speed hitherto only available using statically
typed languages." (Details <a href="https://www.stups.uni-duesseldorf.de/projects.php">in German</a> or <a href="https://www.vinnova.se/PageFiles/38789/ppt/Beatrice_During.pdf">in Swedish</a> :-)</p>
<p>A subgoal is to improve our development and testing infrastructure,
mainly showcased by Holger's recent <a class="reference" href="https://pytest.org/">py.test</a> releases, the testing tool
used by PyPy for its <a class="reference" href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/summary">16K tests</a> and the <a class="reference" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">speed.pypy.org</a> infrastructure
(web app programmed by Miquel Torres on his own time).</p>
<p>The overall scope of this project is smaller than that of the previous EU project
from 2004 to 2007.  The persons that are (or were) getting money to work
on PyPy are Samuele Pedroni (at Open End), Maciej Fijalkowski (as a
subcontractor), Carl Friedrich Bolz, Armin Rigo, Antonio Cuni (all at
HHU), and Holger Krekel (at merlinux) as well as Ronny Pfannschmidt (as
a subcontractor).</p>
<p>The Eurostars funding lasts until August 2011.  What comes afterwards?
Well, for one, many of the currently funded people have done work without
getting funding in previous years.  This will probably continue.
We also have non-funded people in the core group right now and we'll
hope to enlarge it further.  But of course there are still large tasks
ahead which may greatly benefit from funding.  We have setup a
<a class="reference" href="https://pypy.org/">donation</a> infrastructure and maybe we can win one or more larger
organisations to provide higher or regular sums of money to fund future
development work.   Another possibility for companies is to pay
PyPy developers to help and improve PyPy for their particular use cases.</p>
<p>And finally, your help, donations and suggestions are always
welcome and overall we hope to convince more and more people it's
worthwhile to invest into PyPy's future.</p></body></html>
