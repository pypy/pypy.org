<html><body><p>We're pleased to announce the 1.4 release of PyPy. This is a major breakthrough
in our long journey, as PyPy 1.4 is the first PyPy release that can translate
itself faster than CPython.  Starting today, we are using PyPy more for
our every-day development.  So may you :) You can download it here:</p>

<h2>What is PyPy</h2>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement
for CPython. It is fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/comparison/?exe=2%2B35,1%2B172&amp;ben=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20&amp;env=1&amp;hor=false&amp;bas=2%2B35&amp;chart=normal+bars">pypy 1.4 and cpython 2.6</a> comparison).</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<p>Among its new features, this release includes numerous performance improvements
(which made fast self-hosting possible), a 64-bit JIT backend, as well
as serious stabilization. As of now, we can consider the 32-bit and 64-bit
linux versions of PyPy stable enough to run <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2010/11/running-large-radio-telescope-software.html">in production</a>.</p>
<p>Numerous speed achievements are described on <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com">our blog</a>. Normalized speed

are available on the benchmark website. For the impatient: yes, we got a lot faster!</p>

<h2>More highlights</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyPy's built-in Just-in-Time compiler is fully transparent and
automatically generated; it now also has very reasonable memory
requirements.  The total memory used by a very complex and
long-running process (translating PyPy itself) is within 1.5x to
at most 2x the memory needed by CPython, for a speed-up of 2x.</li>
<li>More compact instances.  All instances are as compact as if
they had <tt class="docutils literal">__slots__</tt>.  This can give programs a big gain in
memory.  (In the example of translation above, we already have
carefully placed <tt class="docutils literal">__slots__</tt>, so there is no extra win.)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2010/08/using-virtualenv-with-pypy.html">Virtualenv support</a>: now PyPy is fully compatible with <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>: note that
to use it, you need a recent version of virtualenv (&gt;= 1.5).</li>
<li>Faster (and JITted) regular expressions - huge boost in speeding up
the <cite>re</cite> module.</li>
<li>Other speed improvements, like JITted calls to functions like map().</li>
</ul>
