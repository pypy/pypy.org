<html><body><p>As could be foreseen by my <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2010/08/call-for-benchmarks.html">Call for Memory Benchmarks</a> post a while ago, I am
currently working on improving the memory behaviour of PyPy's Python
interpreter. In this blog post I want to describe the various data a Python
instance can store. Then I want to describe how a branch that I did and that was
recently merged implements the various features of instances in a very
memory-efficient way.</p>
<div class="section" id="python-s-object-model">
<h2>Python's Object Model</h2>
<p>All "normal" new-style Python instances (i.e. instances of subclasses of <tt class="docutils literal">object</tt>
without added declarations) store two (or possibly three) kinds of information.</p>
<div class="section" id="storing-the-class">
<h3>Storing the Class</h3>
<p>Every instance knows which class it belongs to. This information is accessible
via the <tt class="docutils literal">.__class__</tt> attribute. It can also be changed to other (compatible
enough) classes by writing to that attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="instance-variables">
<h3>Instance Variables</h3>
<p>Every instance also has an arbitrary number of attributes stored (also called
instance variables). The instance variables used can vary per instance, which is
not the case in most other class-based languages: traditionally (e.g. in
Smalltalk or Java) the class describes the shape of its instances,
which means that the
set of admissible instance variable names is the same for all instances of a
class.</p>
<p>In Python on the other hand, it is possible to add arbitrary attributes to an
instance at any point. The instance behaves like a dictionary mapping attribute
names (as strings) to the attribute values.</p>
<p>This is actually how CPython implements instances. Every instance has a
reference to a dictionary that stores all the attributes of the instance. This
dictionary can be reached via the <tt class="docutils literal">.__dict__</tt> attribute. To make things more
fun, the dictionary can also be <em>changed</em> by writing to that attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>As an example, consider the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f0f3f3;"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span style="color: #006699; font-weight: bold;">class</span> <span style="color: #00AA88; font-weight: bold;">A</span>(<span style="color: #336666;">object</span>):
    <span style="color: #006699; font-weight: bold;">pass</span>

instance1 <span style="color: #555555;">=</span> A()
instance1<span style="color: #555555;">.</span>x <span style="color: #555555;">=</span> <span style="color: #FF6600;">4</span>
instance1<span style="color: #555555;">.</span>y <span style="color: #555555;">=</span> <span style="color: #FF6600;">6</span>
instance1<span style="color: #555555;">.</span>z <span style="color: #555555;">=</span> <span style="color: #555555;">-</span><span style="color: #FF6600;">1</span>

instance2 <span style="color: #555555;">=</span> A()
instance2<span style="color: #555555;">.</span>x <span style="color: #555555;">=</span> <span style="color: #FF6600;">1</span>
instance2<span style="color: #555555;">.</span>y <span style="color: #555555;">=</span> <span style="color: #FF6600;">2</span>
instance2<span style="color: #555555;">.</span>z <span style="color: #555555;">=</span> <span style="color: #FF6600;">3</span>
</pre></div>
<p>These two instances would look something like this in memory:</p>
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TN6__OBefcI/AAAAAAAAAMg/vmOMwGa5mKw/s1600/instance-grey.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5539075684529241538" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TN6__OBefcI/AAAAAAAAAMg/vmOMwGa5mKw/s400/instance-grey.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 400px; height: 57px;"></a>
<p>(The picture glosses over a number of details, but it still shows the essential
issues.)</p>
<p>This way of storing things is simple, but unfortunately rather inefficient. Most
instances of the same class have the same shape, i.e. the same set of instance
attribute names. That means that the key part of all the dictionaries is
identical (shown grey here). Therefore storing that part repeatedly in all
instances is a waste. In addition, dictionaries are themselves rather large.
Since they are typically implemented as hashmaps, which must not be too full to
be efficient, a dictionary will use something like 6 words on average per key.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="slots">
<h3>Slots</h3>
<p>Since normal instances are rather large, CPython 2.2 introduced slots, to make
instances consume less memory. Slots are a way to fix the set of attributes an
instance can have. This is achieved by adding a declaration to a class, like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f0f3f3;"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span style="color: #006699; font-weight: bold;">class</span> <span style="color: #00AA88; font-weight: bold;">B</span>(<span style="color: #336666;">object</span>):
    __slots__ <span style="color: #555555;">=</span> [<span style="color: #CC3300;">"x"</span>, <span style="color: #CC3300;">"y"</span>, <span style="color: #CC3300;">"z"</span>]
</pre></div>
<p>Now the instances of <tt class="docutils literal">B</tt> can only have <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">y</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">z</tt> as attributes
and don't have a dictionary at all. Instead, the instances of <tt class="docutils literal">B</tt> get
allocated with enough size to hold exactly the number of instance variables that
the class permits. This clearly saves a lot of memory over the dictionary
approach, but has a number of disadvantages. It is obviously less flexible, as
you cannot add additional instance variables to an instance if you happen to
need to do that. It also introduces a set of <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#slots">rules and corner-cases</a> that can
be surprising sometimes (e.g. instances of a subclass of a class with slots that
doesn't have a slots declaration will have a dict).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-maps-for-memory-efficient-instances">
<h2>Using Maps for Memory-Efficient Instances</h2>
<p>As we have seen in the diagram above, the dictionaries of instances of the same
class tend to look very similar and share all the keys. The central idea to use
less memory is to "factor out" the common parts of the instance dictionaries
into a new object, called a "map" (because it is a guide to the landscape of the
object, or something). After that factoring out, the representation of the
instances above looks something like this:</p>
<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TN6__c74O3I/AAAAAAAAAMo/CxNPGbfD8bc/s1600/instancemap.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5539075688532294514" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TN6__c74O3I/AAAAAAAAAMo/CxNPGbfD8bc/s400/instancemap.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 400px; height: 59px;"></a>
<p>Every instance now has a reference to its map, which describes what the instance
looks like. The actual instance variables are stored in an array (called
<tt class="docutils literal">storage</tt> in the diagram). In the example here, the map describes that the
instances have three attributes <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">y</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">z</tt>. The numbers after the
attributes are indexes into the storage array.</p>
<p>If somebody adds a new attribute to one of the instances, the map for that
instance will be changed to another map that also contains the new attribute,
and the storage will have to grow a field with the new attribute. The maps are
immutable, immortal and reused as much as possible. This means, that two
instances of the same class with the same set of attributes will have the same
map. This also means that the memory the map itself uses is not too important,
because it will potentially be amortized over many instances.</p>
<p>Note that using maps makes instances nearly as small as if the correct slots had
been declared in the class. The only overhead needed is the indirection to the
storage array, because you can get new instance variables, but not new slots.</p>
<p>The concept of a "map" that describes instances is kind of old and comes from
the virtual machine for the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_%28programming_language%29">Self</a> programming language. The optimization was
first described in 1989 in a paper by Chambers, Ungar and Lee with the title <a class="reference external" href="https://labs.oracle.com/self/papers/implementation.html">An
Efficient Implementation of Self, a Dynamically-Typed Object-Oriented Language
Based on Prototypes</a>. A similar technique is used in Google's V8 JavaScript
engine, where the maps are called <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/apis/v8/design.html#prop_access">hidden classes</a> and in the <a class="reference external" href="https://blogs.sun.com/jrose/entry/javaone_in_2010">Rhino
JavaScript engine</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of the post describes a number of further details that occur if
instances are implemented using maps.</p>
<div class="section" id="supporting-dictionaries-with-maps">
<h3>Supporting Dictionaries with Maps</h3>
<p>The default instance representation with maps as shown above works without
actually having a dictionary as part of each instance. If a dictionary is
actually requested, by accessing the <tt class="docutils literal">.__dict__</tt> attribute, it needs to be
created and cached. The dictionary is not a normal Python dictionary, but a thin
wrapper around the object that forwards all operations to it. From the user's
point of view it behaves like a normal dictionary though (it even has the
correct type).</p>
<p>The dictionary needs to be cached, because accessing <tt class="docutils literal">.__dict__</tt> several times
should always return the same dictionary. The caching happens by using a
different map that knows about the dictionary and putting the dictionary into
the storage array:</p>
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TN6__ibswtI/AAAAAAAAAMw/ZBY7pvZAel8/s1600/dictinstancemap.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5539075690007937746" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TN6__ibswtI/AAAAAAAAAMw/ZBY7pvZAel8/s400/dictinstancemap.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 400px; height: 102px;"></a>
<p>Things become really complex if the fake dict is used in strange ways. As long
as the keys are strings, everything is fine. If somebody adds other keys to the
dict, they cannot be represented by the map any more (which supports only
attributes, i.e. string keys in the <tt class="docutils literal">__dict__</tt>). If that happens, all the
information of the instance will move into the fake dictionary, like this:</p>
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TN6___mTkZI/AAAAAAAAAM4/2F-B8drBvKk/s1600/dictinstancemapdevolved.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5539075697837052306" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TN6___mTkZI/AAAAAAAAAM4/2F-B8drBvKk/s400/dictinstancemapdevolved.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 400px; height: 249px;"></a>
<p>In this picture, the key <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-1</span></tt> was added to the instance's dictionary. Since
using the dictionary in arbitrary ways should be rare, we are fine with the
additional time and memory that the approach takes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="slots-and-maps">
<h3>Slots and Maps</h3>
<p>Maps work perfectly together with slots, because the slots can just be stored
into the storage array used by the maps as well (in practise there are some
refinements to that scheme).  This means that putting a <tt class="docutils literal">__slots__</tt> on a
class has mostly no effect, because the instance only stores the values of the
attributes (and not the names), which is equivalent to the way slots are stored
in CPython.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation-details">
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>In the diagrams above, I represented the maps as flat objects. In practise this
is a bit more complex, because it needs to be efficient to go from one map to
the next when new attributes are added. Thus the maps are organized in a tree.</p>
<p>The instances with their maps from above look a bit more like this in practise:</p>
<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TN7AABHntqI/AAAAAAAAANA/YHVsUp51d60/s1600/realmap.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5539075698245220002" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zICyAWqZbLA/TN7AABHntqI/AAAAAAAAANA/YHVsUp51d60/s400/realmap.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 400px; height: 271px;"></a>
<p>Every map just describes one attribute of the object, with a name and a an
index. Every map also has a <tt class="docutils literal">back</tt> field, that points to another map
describing what the rest of the object looks like. This chain ends with a
terminator, which also stores the class of the object.</p>
<p>The maps also contain the information necessary for making a new object of
class <tt class="docutils literal">A</tt>. Immediately after the new object has been created, its map is the
terminator. If the <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> attribute is added, its maps is changed to the
second-lowest map, and so on. The blue arrows show the sequence of maps that
the new object goes through when the attributes <tt class="docutils literal">x, y, z</tt> are added.</p>
<p>This representation of maps as chains of objects sounds very inefficient if an
object has many attributes. The whole chain has to be walked to find the index.
This is true to some extent. The problem goes away in the presence of the JIT,
which knows that the chain of maps is an immutable structure, and will thus
optimize away all the chain-walking. If the JIT is not used, there are a few
caches that try to speed up the walking of this chain (similar to the method
cache in CPython and PyPy).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>It's hard to compare the improvements of this optimization in a fair way, as
the trade-offs are just very different. Just to give an impression, a million
objects of the same class with three fields on a 32bit system takes:</p>
<p>without slots:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>182 MiB memory in CPython</li>
<li>177 MiB memory in PyPy without maps</li>
<li>40 MiB memory in PyPy with maps</li>
</ul>
<p>with slots:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>45 MiB memory in CPython</li>
<li>50 MiB memory in PyPy without maps</li>
<li>40 MiB memory in PyPy with maps</li>
</ul>
<p>Note how maps make the objects a bit more efficient like CPython using slots.
Also, using slots has no additional effect in PyPy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Maps are a powerful approach to shrinking the memory used by many similar
instances. I think they can be pushed even further (e.g. by adding information
about the types of the attributes) and plan to do so in the following months.
Details will be forthcoming.</p>
