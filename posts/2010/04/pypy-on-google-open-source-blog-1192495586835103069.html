<html><body><p>Hello</p>
<p>Bea Düring, from the PyPy team, wrote a post for <a href="https://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/04/pypy-12-released.html">google open source blog</a> covering PyPy's 1.2 release. It's also the first public mention of the fact that <a href="https://google.com">google</a> provided financial support for PyPy's 2.5 compatibility. Thanks!</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
