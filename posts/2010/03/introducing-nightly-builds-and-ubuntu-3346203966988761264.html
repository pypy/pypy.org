<html><body><p>Hello.
</p><p>
We're pleased to announce two things that we were constantly asked for: <a href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/">Nightly builds</a> and <a href="https://launchpad.net/~pypy/+archive/ppa">Ubuntu PPA</a> for 1.2 release made by Bartosz Skowron. There are no nightly build ubuntu packages (yet).
</p>
<p>
Nightly builds are what they are - pure pypy executables with JIT compiled in (for linux only now). They require either a pypy checkout or a release download. The main difference is that by default display more debugging information than release builds and that they contain recent bugfixes and improvements of course :-)
</p>
Cheers<br>
