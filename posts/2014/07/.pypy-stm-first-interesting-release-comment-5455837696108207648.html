<html><body><p>Having a JIT in the JVM is very different from having a JIT that can understand Python.  For proof, the best (and only) implementation of Python on the JVM, Jython, is running at around CPython speed (generally a bit slower).  I suspect that STM is similarly not designed for the purposes to which Jython would put it and would thus perform poorly.  The only part that would probably work out of the box would be the GC.  A more subtle argument against starting from the JVM is that of semantic mismatch.  See for example https://www.stups.uni-duesseldorf.de/mediawiki/images/5/51/Pypy.pdf</p></body></html>
