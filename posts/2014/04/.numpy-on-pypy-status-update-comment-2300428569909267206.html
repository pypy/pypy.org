<html><body><p>Any news on the NumPy front? I check this blog for such stuff every week and also contributed to the funding drive.<br><br>I fully understand that developers skilled enough to work on such a project are hard to come by even with money, and NumPy support isn't probably the most technologically exciting aspect of PyPy.<br><br>Just even a few lines on the latest development or some milestones would show that the project is alive (although I fully understand that writing blog posts isn't everybody's favorite thing). And some kind of summary that in what shape the developers think the code is in. If you prefer coding to blogging, maybe implementing some kind of time-series graph for the numpypy-status page could be nice also (I keep checking it out but can never remember what was the state last time I checked). Maybe I can see if I can do a quick hack via eg archive.org for this.<br><br>I think also a huge boost would be to have even a hacky temporary way to interface with Matplotlib and/or SciPy, as it's quite hard to do many practical analyses without these. I'd probably try to do my analyses in such an environment and perhaps even implement/fix at least things that are my own itches. There was the 2011 hack, but it doesn't seem to be elaborated anywhere. I could live with (or even prefer, so it definitely won't become the permanent version) a ugly, slow, memory-hungry and unstable hack that would spam the stderr with insulting messages. But without any way of interfacing the existing stuff it's just too much work for the more complicated analyses.<br><br>I'm trying to track the https://bitbucket.org/pypy/numpy branch but it's a bit hard to see the bigger picture just from the commits. Even just some tags and/or meta-issues could be helpful. I'm also a bit confused on where (repo-wise) the development is actually happening. There are some sort of fresh NumPy-branches in the numpy tree. The micronumpy-project is probably dead or merged into the pypy/numpy-branch?<br><br>PS. Please don't take this as too strong criticism. I prefer to just silently code away myself too. Just what would be nice to see as somebody eagerly waiting to use Pypy in numerical stuff.</p></body></html>
