<html><body><p>This is the 13th status update about our work on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/all/tip/branch%28%22py3k%22%29">py3k branch</a>, which we<br>
can work on thanks to all of the people who <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/01/py3k-and-numpy-first-stage-thanks-to.html">donated</a> to the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/py3donate.html">py3k proposal</a>.</p><p>We're just finishing up a cleanup of int/long types. This work helps the py3k<br>
branch unify these types into the Python 3 int and restore <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2013/11/py3k-status-update-12.html">JIT compilation of<br>
machine sized integers</a>.</p><p>This cleanup also removes <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/objspace.html#multimethods">multimethods</a> from these types. PyPy has<br>
historically used a clever implementation of multimethod dispatch for declaring<br>
methods of the __builtin__ types in RPython.</p><p>This multimethod scheme provides some convenient features for doing this,<br>
however we've come to the conclusion that it may be more trouble than it's<br>
worth. A major problem of multimethods is that they generate a large amount of<br>
stub methods which burden the already lengthy and memory hungry RPython<br>
translation process. Also, their implementation and behavior can be somewhat<br>
complicated/obscure.</p><p>The alternative to multimethods involves doing the work of the type checking<br>
and dispatching rules in a more verbose, manual way. It's a little more work in<br>
the end but less magical.</p><p>Recently, Manuel Jacob finished a large cleanup effort of the<br>
unicode/string/bytearray types that also removed their multimethods. This work<br>
also benefits the py3k branch: it'll help with future <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0393/">PEP 393</a> (or <a class="reference external" href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/1/9/ucs-vs-utf8/">PEP 393<br>
alternative</a>) work. This effort was partly sponsored by Google's Summer of<br>
Code: thanks Manuel and Google!</p><p>Now there's only a couple major pieces left in the multimethod removal (the<br>
float/complex types and special marshaling code) and a few minor pieces that<br>
should be relatively easy.</p><p>In conclusion, there's been some good progress made on py3k and multimethod<br>
removal this winter, albeit a bit slower than we would have liked.</p><p>cheers,<br>
