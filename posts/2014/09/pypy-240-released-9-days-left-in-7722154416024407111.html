We're pleased to announce the availability of PyPy 2.4.0; faster, fewer bugs, and updated to the python 2.7.8 stdlib.<br>
<br>
This release contains several bugfixes and enhancements. Among the user-facing improvements:<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>internal refactoring in string and GIL handling which led to significant speedups</li>
<li>improved handling of multiple objects (like sockets) in long-running  programs. They are collected and released more efficiently, reducing  memory use. In simpler terms - we closed what looked like a memory leak</li>
<li>Windows builds now link statically to zlib, expat, bzip, and openssl-1.0.1i</li>
<li>Many issues were <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues?status=resolved">resolved</a> since the 2.3.1 release in June </li>
</ul>

<br>
We would like to also point out that in September, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf">the Python Software Foundation</a> will <a class="reference external" href="/posts/2014/09/python-software-foundation-matching-2230529993193139046.html">match funds</a> for any donations up to $10k, so head over to our <a href="https://pypy.org/">website</a> and help this mostly-volunteer effort out.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a> is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://www.python.org/">CPython</a> 2.7 and 3.2.5. It's fast (<a href="https://speed.pypy.org/">pypy 2.4 and cpython 2.7.x performance comparison</a>) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler. <br>
<br>
This  release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64,   Windows, and OpenBSD, as well as newer ARM hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7,   with VFPv3) running Linux.  <br>
We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy project.<br>
