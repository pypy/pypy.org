The PyPy team is proud to release both PyPy2.7 v6.0 (an interpreter supporting
Python 2.7 syntax), and a PyPy3.5 v6.0 (an interpreter supporting Python
3.5 syntax). The two releases are both based on much the same codebase, thus
the dual release.<br>
This release is a feature release following our previous 5.10 incremental
release in late December 2017. Our C-API compatibility layer <b><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cpyext</span></code></b> is
now much faster (see the <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.it/2017/10/cape-of-good-hope-for-pypy-hello-from.html">blog post</a>) as well as more complete. We have made
many other improvements in speed and CPython compatibility. Since the changes
affect the included python development header files, all c-extension modules must
be recompiled for this version.<br>
Until we can work with downstream providers to distribute builds with PyPy, we
have made packages for some common packages <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antocuni/pypy-wheels">available as wheels</a>. You may
compile yourself using <b><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">--no-build-isolation</span> <span class="pre">&lt;package&gt;</span></code></b>, the
<b><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">no-build-isolation</span></code></b> is currently needed for pip v10.<br>
First-time python users are often stumped by silly typos and omissions when
getting started writing code. We have improved our parser to emit more friendly
<a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2018/04/improving-syntaxerror-in-pypy.html">syntax errors</a>,  making PyPy not only faster but more friendly.<br>
The GC now has <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/gc_info.html#gc-hooks">hooks</a> to gain more insights into its performance<br>
The default Matplotlib TkAgg backend now works with PyPy, as do pygame and <a class="reference external" href="https://lazka.github.io/posts/2018-04_pypy-pygobject/index.html">pygobject</a>.<br>
We updated the <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/">cffi</a> module included in PyPy to version 1.11.5, and the
<a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/">cppyy</a> backend to 0.6.0. Please use these to wrap your C and C++ code,
respectively, for a JIT friendly experience.<br>
As always, this release is 100% compatible with the previous one and fixed
several issues and bugs raised by the growing community of PyPy users.
We strongly recommend updating.<br>
The Windows PyPy3.5 release is still considered beta-quality. There are open
issues with unicode handling especially around system calls and c-extensions.<br>
The utf8 branch that changes internal representation of unicode to utf8 did not
make it into the release, so there is still more goodness coming. We also
began working on a Python3.6 implementation, help is welcome.<br>

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work.<br>
We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/index.html">PyPy</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html#make-more-python-modules-pypy-friendly">modules</a> to run
on pypy, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython’s JIT even better.<br>

What is PyPy?</h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7 and CPython 3.5. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.<br>
The PyPy release supports:<br>
<blockquote>
<div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>newer <b>ARM</b> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux,</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <b>PPC64</b> running Linux,</li>
<li><b>s390x</b> running Linux</li>
