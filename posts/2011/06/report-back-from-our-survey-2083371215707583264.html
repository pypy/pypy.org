<html><body><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm here to report back the results of our survey. First, we're very pleased to
report that a number of you guys are happilly running PyPy in production! Most
(97%) of the respondants using PyPy are using it because it's faster, but a
further 26% (respondants could choose multiple answers) are using it because of
lower memory usage. Of users who aren't using PyPy, the most common reason was
C extensions, followed by "Other".</p>
<p>From reading the extra comments section there are a few things we've learned:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Google docs needs a better UI for this stuff</li>
<li>A huge number of people want NumPy and SciPy, it was easily the most
requested C extension (25% of respondants said somthing about NumPy). We've
already blogged on the topic of <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/05/numpy-in-pypy-status-and-roadmap.html">our plans for NumPy</a>.</li>
<li>Having packages in the various OS's repositories would be a big help in
getting users up and running.</li>
</ol>
<p>A huge thanks to everyone who responded! Finally, if you're using PyPy in
production we'd love to get a testimonial from you, if you're willing to spare
a few minutes to give us a quote or two please get in contact with us via <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">our
mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Alex</p></body></html>
