<html><body><p>Good day everyone.</p>
<p>Recent round of optimizations, especially <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/01/loop-invariant-code-motion.html">loop invariant code motion</a>
has been very good for small to medium examples. There is work ongoing to
make them scale to larger ones, however there are few examples worth showing
how well they perform. This one following example, besides getting benefits
from loop invariants, also shows a difference between static and dynamic
compilation. In fact, after applying all the optimizations C does, only a
JIT can use the extra bit of runtime information to run even faster.</p>
<p>The example is as follows. First Python. I create two files, x.py:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def add(a, b):
  return a + b
</pre>
<p>And y.py:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from x import add

def main():
    i = 0
    a = 0.0
    while i &lt; 1000000000:
        a += 1.0
        add(a, a)
        i += 1

main()
</pre>
<p>For C, x.c:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
double add(double a, double b)
{
  return a + b;
}
</pre>
<p>and y.c:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
double add(double a, double b);

int main()
{
  int i = 0;
  double a = 0;
  while (i &lt; 1000000000) {
    a += 1.0;
    add(a, a);
    i++;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Results?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><b>1.97s - PyPy</b></li>
<li><b>3.07s - C</b></li>
</ul>
Compilation options:
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyPy trunk (386ed41eae0c), running pypy-c y.py</li>
<li>C - gcc -O3 (GCC 4.4.5 shipped with Ubuntu Maverick)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, PyPy 50% faster than C on this carefully crafted example. The reason
is obvious - static compiler can't inline across file boundaries. In C,
you can somehow circumvent that, however, it wouldn't anyway work
with shared libraries. In Python however, even when the whole import system
is completely dynamic, the JIT can dynamically find out what can be inlined.
That example would work equally well for Java and other decent JITs, it's
however good to see we work in the same space :-)</p>
