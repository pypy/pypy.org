<html><body><p>Hi all.  Here is (an extract of) a short summary paper about my current position on
Software Transactional Memory as a general tool in the implementation
of Python or Python-like languages.  Thanks to people on IRC for discussion on making
this blog post better (lucian, Alex Gaynor, rguillebert, timonator, Da_Blitz).
For the purpose of the present discussion, we are comparing Java with Python
when it comes to multi-threading.</p>

<h2>The problem in complex high-level languages</h2>
<p>Like Java, the Python language gives guarantees: it is not acceptable
for the Python virtual machine to crash due to incorrect usage of
threads.  A primitive operation in Java is something like reading or
writing a field of an object; the corresponding guarantees are along the
lines of: if the program reads a field of an object, and another thread
writes to the same field of the same object, then the program will see
either the old value, or the new value, but not something else entirely,
and the virtual machine will not crash.</p>
<p>Higher-level languages like Python differ from Java by the fact that a
"primitive operation" is far more complex.  It may for example involve
looking in several hash maps, perhaps doing updates.  In general, it is
completely impossible to map every operation that must be atomic to a
single processor instruction.</p>

<h2>Jython: fine-grained locking</h2>
<p>This problem has been solved "explicitly" in the Jython interpreter that
runs on top of Java.  The solution is explicit in the following sense:
throughout the Jython interpreter, every single operation makes careful
use of Java-level locking mechanisms.  This is an application of
"fine-grained locking".  For example, operations like attribute lookup,
which need to perform look-ups in a number of hash maps, are protected
by acquiring and releasing locks (in __getattribute__).</p>
<p>A draw-back of this solution is the attention to detail required.
If even one place misses a lock, then there is either a
bug --- and such bugs occur in cases that are increasingly rare and hard
to debug as the previous bugs are fixed --- or we just file it under "differences
from CPython".  There is however the risk of
deadlock, if two threads attempt to lock the same objects in different
order.</p>

<p>In practice, the situation is actually not as bad as
I may paint it: the number of locks in Jython is reasonable, and allows for
all the "common cases" to work as expected.
(For the uncommon cases, see below.)</p>

<p>Performance-wise, the Java virtual machine itself comes with locks that
have been heavily optimized over a long period of time, so the
performance is acceptable.  However if this solution were coded in C, it
would need a lot of extra work to optimize the locks manually (possibly
introducing more of the subtle bugs).</p>

<h2>CPython: coarse-grained locking</h2>
<p>CPython, the standard implementation of Python in C, took a different
and simpler approach: it has a single global lock, called the Global
Interpreter Lock (GIL).  It uses "coarse-grained locking": the lock is
acquired and released around the whole execution of one bytecode (or
actually a small number of bytecodes, like 100).  This solution is
enough to ensure that no two operations can conflict with each other,
because the two bytecodes that invoke them are themselves
serialized by the GIL.  It is a solution which avoids --- unlike Jython
--- writing careful lock-acquiring code all over the interpreter.  It
also offers even stronger guarantees: every bytecode runs entirely
atomically.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the draw-back of the GIL approach is obvious on multi-core
machines: by serializing the execution of bytecodes, starting multiple
threads does not actually let the interpreter use of more than one core.</p>
<p>PyPy, the Python implementation in Python, takes the same approach so
far.</p>

<h2>Existing usage</h2>
<p>As we have seen, we have the following situation: the existing Python
language, as CPython implements it, offers very strong guarantees about
multi-threaded usage.  It is important to emphasize that most existing
multi-threaded Python programs actually rely on such strong guarantees.
This can be seen for example in a problem that takes a populated list
and does in several threads:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
next_item = global_list.pop()
</pre>
<p>This implicitly relies on the fact that pop() will perform atomic
removal from the list.  If two threads try to pop() from the same list
at the same time, then the two operations will occur in one order or the
other; but they will not e.g. return the same object to both threads or
mess up the internal state of the list object.</p>
<p>With such an example in mind, it should be clear that we do not want a
solution to the multi-core issue that involves dropping these strong
guarantees.  It is ok however to lower the barrier, as Jython does; but
any Python implementation must offer <i>some</i> guarantees, or not offer
multi-threading at all.  This includes the fact that a lot of methods on
built-in types are supposed to be atomic.</p>

<p>(It should be noted that not offering multi-threading at all is actually
also a (partial) solution to the problem.  Recently, several "hacks"
have appeared that give a programmer more-or-less transparent access to
multiple independent processes (e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing</a>).  While these provide appropriate
solutions in some context, they are not as widely applicable as
multi-threading.  As a typical example, they fail to apply when the
mutiple cores need to process information that cannot be serialized at
all --- a requirement for any data exchange between several processes.)</p>

<p>Here is an example of how Jython's consistency is weaker than CPython's GIL.
It takes uncommon examples to show it, and the fact that it does not work
like a CPython programmer expect them to is generally considered as an
implementation detail.  Consider:</p>
<pre>Thread 1:  set1.update(set2)
Thread 2:  set2.update(set3)
Thread 3:  set3.update(set1)</pre>
<p>Each operation is atomic in the case of CPython, but decomposed in two steps
(which can each be considered atomic) in the case of Jython: reading from the
argument, and then updating the target set.  Suppose that initially
set1 = {1}, set2 = {2}, set3 = {3}.  On CPython, independently on
the order in which the threads run, we will end up with at least one of the
sets being {1, 2, 3}.  On Jython, it is possible that all
three sets end up as containing two items only.  The example is a bit
far-fetched but should show that CPython's consistency is strictly stronger
than Jython's.</p>

<h2>PyPy</h2>
<p>PyPy is a Python interpreter much like CPython or Jython, but the way it
is produced is particular.  It is an interpreter written in RPython, a
subset of Python, which gets turned into a complete virtual machine (as
generated C code) automatically by a step called the "translation".  In
this context, the trade-offs are different from the ones in CPython and
in Jython: it is possible in PyPy, and even easy, to apply arbitrary
whole-program transformations to the interpreter at "translation-time".</p>
<p>With this in mind, it is possible to imagine a whole-program
transformation that would add locking on every object manipulated in
RPython by the interpreter.  This would end up in a situation similar to
Jython.  However, it would not automatically solve the issue of
deadlocks, which is avoided in the case of Jython by careful manual
placement of the locks.  (In fact, being deadlock-free is a global
program property that cannot be automatically ensured or verified; any
change to Jython can in theory break this property, and thus introduce
subtle deadlocks.  The same applies to non-atomicity.)</p>
<p>In fact, we can easily check that if the interpreter accesses (for
both reading and writing)
objects A and B in a bytecode of thread 1, and objects B and A (in the
opposite order) in a bytecode of thread 2 --- and moreover if you need to
have accessed the first object before you can decide that you will need
to access the second object --- then there is no way (apart from the GIL) to avoid
a deadlock while keeping the strong guarantee of atomicity.  Indeed, if
both threads have progressed to the middle of the execution of their
bytecode, then A has already been mutated by thread 1 and similarly B
has already been mutated by thread 2.  It is not possible to
successfully continue running the threads in that case.</p>

<h2>Using Software Transactional Memory</h2>
<p>Software Transactional Memory (STM) is an approach that gives a solution
to precisely the above problem.  If a thread ended up in a situation
where continuing to run it would be wrong, then we can <i>abort and
rollback.</i>  This is similar to the notion of transaction on databases.
In the above example, one or both threads would notice that they are
about to run into troubles and abort.  This means more concretely that
they need to have a way to restart execution at the start of the
bytecode, with all the side-effects of what they did so far being either
cancelled or just not committed yet.</p>
<p>We think that this capacity to abort and rollback is the missing piece
of the puzzle of multi-threaded implementations of Python.
Actually, according to the presentation of the problem given
above, it is unavoidable that any solution that wants to offer the
same level of consistency and atomicity as CPython would involve
the capacity of aborting and rolling back --- <i>which means precisely
that STM cannot be avoided.</i></p>

<p>Ok, but why not settle down with Jython's
approach and put careful locks left and right throughout the interpreter?
Because (1) we would have to consider every operation's atomicity and make decisions
(or steal Jython's) and document them
<a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cpython_differences.html">here</a>;
(2) it would also be really a lot of work, to optimize these locks e.g. with the
JIT as well as the JVM does; and (3) it is not the PyPy way to require manually
tweaking your code everywhere for a feature that should be orthogonal.  Point
(3) is probably the most important here: you need to redo the work for every
language you implement in PyPy.
It also implies my own point (4): <i>it is not fun :-)</i></p>

<p>In more details, the process would work as follows.  (This gives an
overview of one possible model; it is possible that a different model
will end up being better.)  In every thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the start of a bytecode, we start a "transaction".  This means
setting up a thread-local data structure to record a log of what
occurs in the transaction.</li>
<li>We record in the log all objects that are read, as well as the
modifications that we would like to make.</li>
<li>During this time, we detect "read" inconsistencies, shown by the
object's "last-modified" timestamp being later than the start time
of the current transaction, and abort.  This prevents the rest of
the code from running with inconsistent values.</li>
<li>If we reach the end of the bytecode without a "read" inconsistency,
then we atomically check for "write" inconsistencies.  These are
inconsistencies which arise from concurrent updates to objects
in the other threads --- either our "write" objects, or our "read"
objects.</li>
<li>If no inconsistency is found, we "commit" the transaction by copying
the delayed writes from the log into main memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>The points at which a transaction starts or ends are exactly the
points at which, in CPython, the Global Interpreter Lock is
respectively acquired and released.  If we ignore the fact that (purely for
performance) CPython acquires and releases the GIL only every N bytecodes,
then this means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Before any bytecode we acquire the GIL (start a transaction), and after
the bytecode we release it (ends the transaction); and
</li><li>Before doing an external call to the C library or the OS we release the GIL
(ends the transaction) and afterwards re-acquire it (start the next transaction).
</li></ol>
So in particular this model is well suited to the STM condition that we cannot
do anything in a transaction that cannot be rolled back, like --- precisely ---
system calls.  Indeed, by construction, these system calls occur outside a
transaction, because in CPython they occur with the GIL released.

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>A large number of implementation details are still open for now.
From a user's point of view (i.e. the programmer using Python),
the most relevant one is the overall performance impact.  We
cannot give precise numbers so far, and we expect the initial
performance to be abysmally bad (maybe 10x slower); however, with
successive improvements to the locking mechanism, to the global
program transformation inserting the locks, to the garbage 
collector (GC), and to the Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler, we
believe that it should be possible to get a roughly reasonable
performance (up to maybe 2x slower).  For example, the GC can
maintain flags on the objects to know that they did not escape
their creation thread, and do not need any logging; and the JIT
compiler can aggregate several reads or writes to an object into
one.  We believe that these are the kind of optimizations that
can give back a lot of the performance lost.</p>

<h2>The state of STM</h2>
<p>Transactional Memory is itself a relatively old idea, originating
from a 1986 paper by Tom Knight.  At first based on hardware
support, the idea of software-only transactional memory (STM) was
popularized in 1995 and has recently been the focus of intense 
research.</p>
<p>The approach outlined above --- using STM to form the core of the
implementation of a language --- is new, as far as we know.  So
far, most implementations provide STM as a library feature.  It
requires explicit usage, often in the form of explicitly
declaring which objects must be protected by STM (object-based
STMs).  It is only recently that native STM support has started
to appear, notably in the Clojure language.</p>
<p>STM is described on Wikipedia as an approach that "greatly
simplifies conceptual understanding of multithreaded programs and
helps make programs more maintainable by working in harmony with
existing high-level abstractions such as objects and modules."
We actually think that these benefits are important enough to
warrant being exposed to the Python programmer as well, instead
of being used only internally.  This would give the Python
programmer a very simple interface:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
with atomic:
    &lt;these operations are executed atomically&gt;
</pre>
<p>(This is <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-February/033259.html">an old idea.</a>  Funny how back in 2003 people, including me, thought that this was a hack.  Now I'm writing a blog post to say "it was not a hack; it's explicitly using locks that is a hack."  I'm buying the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory#Composable_operations">composability.</a>)</p>

<p>From a practical point of view, I started looking seriously at
the University of Rochester STM (RSTM), a C++ library that has
been a focus of --- and a collection of results from --- recent
research.  One particularly representative paper is
<a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/spear/ppopp09.pdf">A
Comprehensive Strategy for Contention Management in Software
Transactional Memory</a> by Michael F. Spear, Luke Dalessandro,
Virendra J. Marathe and Michael L. Scott.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Taking these ideas and applying them in the context of an
implementation of a complex high-level language like Python comes
with its own challanges.  In this context, using PyPy makes sense
as both an experimentation platform and as a platform that is
recently gaining attention for its performance.  The alternatives
are unattractive: doing it in CPython for example would mean
globally rewriting the interpreter.  In PyPy instead, we write it
as a transformation that is applied systematically at translation-time.
Also, PyPy is a general platform for generating fast interpreters
for dynamic languages; the STM implementation in PyPy would work
out of the box for other language implementations as well, instead
of just for Python.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>This is mostly me (Armin Rigo) ranting aloud and trying experiments;
this post should not be confused as meaning that the whole PyPy team
will now spend the next years working on it full-time.
As I said it is orthogonal to the actual Python interpreter, and it is in
any case a feature that can be turned on or off during translation; I know
that in many or most use cases, people are more interested in getting a
fast PyPy rather than one which is twice as slow but scales well.
</li><li>Nothing I said is really new.  For proof, see
<a href="https://sabi.net/nriley/pubs/dls6-riley.pdf">Riley and Zilles (2006)</a>
as well as <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~fuad/parpycan.pdf">Tabba (2010)</a> who both experimented with <i>Hardware</i> Transactional Memory, turning CPython or PyPy interpreter's GIL into start/end transactions, as I describe here.
