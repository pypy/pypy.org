      <p>We're pleased to announce the 1.7 release of PyPy. As became a habit, this
release brings a lot of bugfixes and performance improvements over the 1.6
release. However, unlike the previous releases, the focus has been on widening
the "sweet spot" of PyPy. That is, classes of Python code that PyPy can greatly
speed up should be vastly improved with this release. You can download the 1.7
release here:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/download.html">https://pypy.org/download.html</a>

<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h3>What is PyPy?<a href="#what-is-pypy" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7. It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">pypy 1.7 and cpython 2.7.1</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>This release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 32/64 or
Windows 32. Windows 64 work is ongoing, but not yet natively supported.</p>
<p>The main topic of this release is widening the range of code which PyPy
can greatly speed up. On average on
our benchmark suite, PyPy 1.7 is around <strong>30%</strong> faster than PyPy 1.6 and up
to <strong>20 times</strong> faster on some benchmarks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="highlights">
<h3>Highlights<a href="#highlights" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first">Numerous performance improvements. There are too many examples which python
constructs now should behave faster to list them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Bugfixes and compatibility fixes with CPython.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Windows fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">PyPy now comes with stackless features enabled by default. However,
any loop using stackless features will interrupt the JIT for now, so no real
performance improvement for stackless-based programs. Contact pypy-dev for
info how to help on removing this restriction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">NumPy effort in PyPy was renamed numpypy. In order to try using it, simply
write:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import numpypy as numpy
</pre>
<p>at the beginning of your program. There is a huge progress on numpy in PyPy
since 1.6, the main feature being implementation of dtypes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">JSON encoder (but not decoder) has been replaced with a new one. This one
is written in pure Python, but is known to outperform CPython's C extension
up to <strong>2 times</strong> in some cases. It's about <strong>20 times</strong> faster than
the one that we had in 1.6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The memory footprint of some of our RPython modules has been drastically
improved. This should impact any applications using for example cryptography,
like tornado.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">There was some progress in exposing even more CPython C API via cpyext.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="things-that-didn-t-make-it-expect-in-1-8-soon">
<h3>Things that didn't make it, expect in 1.8 soon<a href="#things-that-didn-t-make-it-expect-in-1-8-soon" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is an ongoing work, which while didn't make it to the release, is
probably worth mentioning here. This is what you should probably expect in
1.8 some time soon:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Specialized list implementation. There is a branch that implements lists of
integers/floats/strings as compactly as array.array. This should drastically
improve performance/memory impact of some applications</li>
<li>NumPy effort is progressing forward, with multi-dimensional arrays coming
soon.</li>
<li>There are two brand new JIT assembler backends, notably for the PowerPC and
ARM processors.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fundraising">
<h3>Fundraising<a href="#fundraising" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>It's maybe worth mentioning that we're running fundraising campaigns for
NumPy effort in PyPy and for Python 3 in PyPy. In case you want to see any
of those happen faster, we urge you to donate to <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/numpydonate.html">numpy proposal</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/py3donate.html">py3k proposal</a>. In case you want PyPy to progress, but you trust us with
the general direction, you can always donate to the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org">general pot</a>.</p>

          <p>The point he, she, or it is making is that PyPy should contain a theorem prover to verify the code it generates so it is possible to prove mathematically that it never generates bad code—and that anything else is beneath the contempt of a serious computer scientist.

          <p>It's possible if you let the verifier reject legal code. It's probably not realistic though, RPython (or is that the JIT-annotation language?) would have to be designed to be verifiable for whatever property you want to verify.</p>

          <p>@⚛: you're sitting in your own corner of the world thinking that we will try hard to figure out which segfault you could possibly mean, and that it will help the PyPy project :-)  I've heard many misconceptions of how Open Source works, but I've never heard this one.<br><br>How it really works is: you think you have a genuine segfault and want to report it, in which case you file a bug to https://bugs.pypy.org, and maybe we have to discuss more to figure out why, for example, it appears on your machine and not ours, or which configuration you need to reproduce it; sometimes it can take efforts on both parties to even reproduce the problem.<br><br>You are free to not play this game, but then just like Maciej said, you will be fully ignored.  Even if it's a real bug, it's likely that over time someone else will report or fix it.  I'm not trying to force you to "reveal" it to us; feel free to ignore me.  I'm just explaining how I believe Open Source works.<br><br>The difference for us is small, because a real bug will be seen and reported by others too.  The difference for you is whether you would like to contribute and get our thanks, or don't care about it.</p>

          <p>The pypy team "could" solve it. But it would be a massive waste of time, and of cource the changes are that they are unable to because of problems in your setup. I most certainly hope no open source team really spend their time on such ghost hunts.</p>

          <p>Somewhat off the topic of this post, but I'm wondering what the special optimization of string lists would be. I can see obvious benefits to storing ints/floats directly in the list rather then as boxed numbers, but not so much for strings since they have be stored using an indirection anyways.</p>

          <p>@Winston:<br><br>astutely observed (as always). There are two points to string lists: <br><br>1) PyPy's strings have one extra indirection, e.g. the data is not stored in the string box. This is due to RPython restrictions. With string lists, one indirection can be removed.<br><br>2) If the JIT knows that the full list stores only strings, it can actually generate better code, because it does not need to check the type of the item that was just read out of the list.</p>
