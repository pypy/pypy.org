<html><body><p>Nofrak: you ask good questions.  I'd say you need to know your way around Python programming in general which you most certainly do if you have done desktop or Web apps in Python.<br><br>Secondly, it's important to know a bit about the basic structure of an Python interpreter.  Reading some docs, among them Chapter 1 of https://codespeak.net/pypy/trunk/pypy/doc/coding-guide.html#overview-and-motivation should help.  <br><br>Thirdly, methodology: PyPy is written in a test-driven way, and for the Python interpreter there are several places for tests: one is the (sometimes slightly modified) standard CPython tests in the lib-python/(modified-)2.7.0 directory, another is pypy/objspace/std/test.  The implementation of the interpreter mainly is written down in pypy/objspace/std/*.py.<br><br>Hope that helps a bit.  IRC is a good place to ask for further directions, of course.</p></body></html>
