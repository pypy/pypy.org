      <p>We've been working on PyPy for a long time. But readers of this blog will know
that in the past year something has changed: we think PyPy is production ready.
And it's not just us, this week <a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/">LWN.net</a> wrote an article about how <a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/442268/22f66371348bd7c5/">PyPy
sped up one of their scripts by a factor of three</a>, noting that, "plans are to
run gitdm under PyPy from here on out". All in all we think PyPy is pretty
great, but not everyone is using it yet, and we want to know why. We want your
feedback on why PyPy isn't ready to be your only Python yet, and how we can
improve it to make that happen.</p>
<p>Therefore, we've put together a quick survey, whether you're using PyPy or not
if you could take a few minutes to fill it out and let us know how we're doing
we'd really appreciate it. You can find the form <a class="reference external" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dF9NZlFpNldNS05fdFVKMnpKZVFzN0E6MQ#gid=0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks,
The PyPy team</p>

          <p>We are very interested in using PyPy in production but our project is based on lxml library and both are incompatible. Do you suggest any fix for this? I'm not sure if PyPy would compensate the reduction if performance of a pure Python XML library.</p>

          <p>Pypy needs to either be a dropin replacement for python or provide a significant (order of magnitude) difference in performance that moving to pypy won't be as big of a deal when you lose the support of so many 3rd party libraries.</p>

          <p>I'd love to use PyPy in some of my projects, but they rely on lots of 3rd-party C/C++-based libraries.<br><br>1) lxml, thats an absolute must for most of my applications.

          <p>I would like to repeat the numpy and scipy thing. I have to add matplotlib, which a lot of people use for plotting. Personally I also cannot live without h5py, which is awesome for storing and handling numerical data.

          <p>On my server I'm running couple of Django based ecommerce systems. I hope to be running more of them soon (hopefully). There is also PostgreSQL. Still not using PyPy but I just can't wait to check if it will be faster and if so then how much. I don't know yet how to run Django app on production on PyPy but as soon I check and run couple of performance tests I will surely give some feedback.</p>

          <p>The pypy group should make a full featured ide with a gui designer with built in packaging to .exe and linux .deb and .rpm that only runs the pypy vm. That would bring the desktop application programmers in by the droves.</p>

          <p>Well, basically, it's NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and MayaVi. I'm also using Cython to optimize computation intensive code paths, but of course it would be nicer to stick to pure Python and let JIT do it's magic.</p>

          <p>The only thing that makes me not using pypy is the lack of supporting python bynaries .so, .pyd, etc.<br>I know that is a hard feature to implement because is needed to stub the CPython api.<br>but I think when its done will there is no reasons to not using pypy for anybody.</p>
