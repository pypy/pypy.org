<html><body><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>We are in the process of migrating the hosting machine for PyPy, moving away from <a href="https://codespeak.net">codespeak.net</a> and towards a mixture of custom servers (e.g. for <a href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/">buildbot.pypy.org</a>) and wide-scale services (e.g. for the docs, <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/">now at readthedocs.org</a>).</p>

<p>When this is done, a proper announce will be posted here.  In the meantime, we have already moved the mailing lists, now hosted on python.org.  The subscribers' list have been copied, so if you didn't notice anything special for the past week, then everything works fine :-)  This concerns <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-dev">pypy-dev</a>, <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-issue">pypy-issue</a> and <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pypy-commit">pypy-commit</a>.  Two notes:
</p><ul><li>Some settings have not been copied, notably if you used to disable mail delivery.  Sorry about that; you have to re-enter such settings.
</li><li>Following the move, about 50 addresses have been dropped for being invalid.  I'm unsure why they were not dropped earlier, but in case sending mail to you from python.org instead of codespeak.net fails, then you have been dropped from the mailing lists, and you need to subscribe again.
