<html><body><p>This is part 4 and the <strong>final</strong> part of the series on how to speed up an interpreter
written with PyPy by adding JIT hints to the interpreter. Part 1 described how
to <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/03/controlling-tracing-of-interpreter-with.html">control the extent of tracing</a>. Part 2 described how to <a class="reference external" href="/posts/2011/03/controlling-tracing-of-interpreter-with_15-3281215865169782921.html">influence the
optimizer with promotion and pure functions</a>. Part 3 described a <a class="reference external" href="/posts/2011/03/controlling-tracing-of-interpreter-with_21-6524148550848694588.html">simple object
model and how it can be optimized</a> by doing small rewrites. In this (short) post
I present some benchmarks.</p>
<div class="section" id="benchmarks">
<h2>Benchmarks</h2>
<p>For the benchmarks I ran a subset of the benchmarks on <a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">https://speed.pypy.org</a>
with CPython and four different executables of PyPy's Python interpreter (all
with a JIT). The executables contain all combinations of enabling maps (which
make instance attributes fast) and type versions (which makes method lookup
fast).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>pypy-slow</strong>: contains neither maps nor type versions.</li>
<li><strong>pypy-map</strong>: contains maps but not type versions.</li>
<li><strong>pypy-version</strong>: contains type versions but not maps.</li>
<li><strong>pypy-full</strong>: contains both maps <em>and</em> type versions</li>
</ul>
<p>The results are as follows:</p>
<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tzvNLyIUk2g/TY4mMvBzHYI/AAAAAAAAAP8/1Kc6uR3Mb14/s1600/bench-objmodel.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5588446187837660546" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tzvNLyIUk2g/TY4mMvBzHYI/AAAAAAAAAP8/1Kc6uR3Mb14/s600/bench-objmodel.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 600px;"></a>
<p>The graph shows the speedup over CPython's numbers. The results are quite
interesting. Maps by themselves do not speed up much over the bare JIT, whereas
typed versions alone improve on the JIT baseline in many cases. However, maps
are not useless. In combination with type versions they add a nice improvement
over just type versions in a number of benchmarks (most notably
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">raytrace-simple</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">richards</tt> but also in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">crypto-pyaes</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">django</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">go</tt>).</p>
<p>It's clear that type versions can be arbitrarily effective. A method lookup on a
class can be arbitrarily slow, if the inheritance hierarchy becomes deeper and
deeper. The full lookup is replaced by one promotion if type versions are
enabled.</p>
<p>Maps on the other hand always replace one dict lookup with one promotion. Since
dict lookups are already very fast, this by itself does not lead to a gigantic
improvement. Only in combination with type versions do they show their full
potential.</p>
