<html><body><p>Finally!  CFFI 1.0 is almost ready.  CFFI gives Python developers a convenient way to call external C libraries.  Here "Python" == "CPython or PyPy", but this post is mostly about the CPython side of CFFI, as the PyPy version is not ready yet.</p>
<p>On CPython, you can download the version
"1.0.0b1" either by looking for the <code>cffi-1.0</code> branch in
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/cffi/cffi">the repository</a>, or by
saying</p>

<tt class="docutils literal">pip install <span class="pre">"cffi&gt;=1.0.dev0"</span></tt>

<p>(Until 1.0 final is ready,
<tt class="docutils literal">pip install cffi</tt> will still give you version 0.9.2.)</p>
<p>The main news: you can now explicitly generate and compile a CPython C
extension module from a "build" script.  Then in the rest of your
program or library, you no longer need to import cffi at all.
Instead, you simply say:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from _my_custom_module import ffi, lib
</pre>
<p>Then you use <tt class="docutils literal">ffi</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">lib</tt> just like you did in your
<tt class="docutils literal">verify()</tt>-based project in CFFI 0.9.2.  (The <tt class="docutils literal">lib</tt> is what used to
be the result of <tt class="docutils literal">verify()</tt>.)  The details of <em>how</em> you use them
should not have changed at all, so that the rest of your program should
not need any update.</p>
<div class="section" id="benefits">
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>This is a big step towards standard practices for making and
distributing Python packages with C extension modules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>on the one hand, you need an explicit compilation step, triggered
here by running the "build" script;</li>
<li>on the other hand, what you gain in return is better control over
when and why the C compilation occurs, and more standard ways to write
distutils- or setuptools-based <tt class="docutils literal">setup.py</tt> files (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, this completely removes one of the main drawbacks of using
CFFI to interface with large C APIs: the start-up time.  In some cases
it could be extreme on slow machines (cases of 10-20 seconds on ARM
boards occur commonly).  Now, the <tt class="docutils literal">import</tt> above is instantaneous.</p>
<p>In fact, none of the pure Python <tt class="docutils literal">cffi</tt> package is needed any more at
runtime (it needs only an internal extension module from CFFI, which
can be installed by doing "<tt class="docutils literal">pip install <span class="pre">cffi-runtime</span></tt>" [*] if you only need that).
The <tt class="docutils literal">ffi</tt> object you get by the import above is of a
completely different class written entirely in C.  The two
implementations might get merged in the future; for now they are
independent, but give two compatible APIs.  The differences are that
some methods like <tt class="docutils literal">cdef()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">verify()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">set_source()</tt> are
omitted from the C version, because it is supposed to be a complete FFI
already; and other methods like <tt class="docutils literal">new()</tt>, which take as parameter a
string describing a C type, are faster now because that string is parsed
using a custom small-subset-of-C parser, written in C too.</p>

<div class="section" id="in-practice">
<h2>In practice</h2>
<p>CFFI 1.0 beta 1 was tested on CPython 2.7 and 3.3/3.4, on Linux and to
some extent on Windows and OS/X.  Its PyPy version is not ready yet,
and the only docs available so far are those below.</p>
<p>This is <em>beta</em> software, so there might be bugs and details may change.  We are interested in hearing any feedback (irc.freenode.net #pypy) or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cffi/cffi/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">bug reports.</a></p>
<p>To use the new features, create a source file that is <em>not</em> imported by the rest of
your project, in which you place (or move) the code to build the FFI
object:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# foo_build.py
import cffi
ffi = cffi.FFI()

ffi.cdef("""
    int printf(const char *format, ...);
""")

ffi.set_source("_foo", """
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
""")   # and other arguments like libraries=[...]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ffi.compile()
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">ffi.set_source()</tt> replaces the <tt class="docutils literal">ffi.verify()</tt> of CFFI 0.9.2.
Calling it attaches the given source code to the ffi object, but this call doesn't
compile or return anything by itself.  It may be placed above the <tt class="docutils literal">ffi.cdef()</tt>
if you prefer.  Its first argument is the name of the C extension module
that will be produced.</p>
<p>Actual compilation (including generating the complete C sources) occurs
later, in one of two places: either in <tt class="docutils literal">ffi.compile()</tt>, shown above,
or indirectly from the <tt class="docutils literal">setup.py</tt>, shown next.</p>
<p>If you directly execute the file <tt class="docutils literal">foo_build.py</tt> above, it will
generate a local file <tt class="docutils literal">_foo.c</tt> and compile it to <tt class="docutils literal">_foo.so</tt> (or the
appropriate extension, like <tt class="docutils literal">_foo.pyd</tt> on Windows).  This is the
extension module that can be used in the rest of your program by saying
"<tt class="docutils literal">from _foo import ffi, lib</tt>".</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="distutils">
<h2>Distutils</h2>
<p>If you want to distribute your program, you write a <tt class="docutils literal">setup.py</tt> using
either distutils or setuptools.  Using setuptools is generally
recommended nowdays, but using distutils is possible too.  We show it
first:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# setup.py
from distutils.core import setup
import foo_build

setup(
    name="example",
    version="0.1",
    py_modules=["example"],
    ext_modules=[foo_build.ffi.distutils_extension()],
)
</pre>
<p>This is similar to the CFFI 0.9.2 way.  It only works if cffi was
installed previously, because otherwise <tt class="docutils literal">foo_build</tt> cannot be
imported.  The difference is that you use <tt class="docutils literal">ffi.distutils_extension()</tt>
instead of <tt class="docutils literal">ffi.verifier.get_extension()</tt>, because there is no longer
any <tt class="docutils literal">verifier</tt> object if you use <tt class="docutils literal">set_source()</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setuptools">
<h2>Setuptools</h2>
<p>The modern way is to write <tt class="docutils literal">setup.py</tt> files based on setuptools, which
can (among lots of other things) handle dependencies.  It is what you
normally get with <tt class="docutils literal">pip install</tt>, too.  Here is how you'd write it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# setup.py
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="example",
    version="0.1",
    py_modules=["example"],
    setup_requires=["cffi&gt;=1.0.dev0"],
    cffi_modules=["foo_build:ffi"],
    install_requires=["cffi-runtime"],    # see [*] below
)
</pre>
<p>Note that "cffi" is mentioned on three lines here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the first time is in <tt class="docutils literal">setup_requires</tt>, which means that cffi will
be locally downloaded and used for the setup.</li>
<li>the second mention is a custom <tt class="docutils literal">cffi_modules</tt> argument.  This
argument is handled by cffi as soon as it is locally downloaded.  It
should be a list of <tt class="docutils literal">"module:ffi"</tt> strings, where the <tt class="docutils literal">ffi</tt> part
is the name of the global variable in that module.</li>
<li>the third mention is in <tt class="docutils literal">install_requires</tt>.  It means that in
order to install this example package, "cffi-runtime" must also be
installed.  This is (or will be) a PyPI entry that only contains a
trimmed down version of CFFI, one that does not include the pure
Python "cffi" package and its dependencies.  None of it is needed at
runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[*] NOTE: The "cffi-runtime" PyPI entry is not ready yet.  For now, use "cffi&gt;=1.0.dev0" instead.</strong>  Considering PyPy, which has got a built-in "_cffi_backend" module, the "cffi-runtime" package could never be upgraded there; but it would still be nice if we were able to upgrade the "cffi" pure Python package on PyPy.  This might require some extra care in writing the interaction code.  We need to sort it out now...</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Special thanks go to the PSF (Python Software Foundation) for their
financial support, without which this work---er... it might likely have occurred anyway, but at an unknown future date :-)</p>
<p>(For reference, the amount I asked for (and got) is equal to one
month of what a Google Summer of Code student gets, for work that will
take a bit longer than one month. At least I personally am running mostly
on such money, and so I want to thank the PSF again for their
contribution to CFFI---and while I'm at it, thanks to all other
contributors to PyPy---for making this job more than an unpaid hobby on
the side :-)</p>
