<html><body><p>Hi Everyone<br>
<br>
Here is what has been done in January thanks to the <a href="https://pypy.org/numpydonate.html" target="_blank">funding of NumPyPy</a>, I would like to thank all the donors and tell you that you can still donate :<br>
</p><ul>
<li>I have focused on implementing the object dtype this month, it is now possible to store objects inside ndarrays using the object dtype</li>
<li>It is also possible to add an object ndarray to any other ndarray (implementing other operators is trivial)</li>
</ul>
<div>
The next things I plan on working on next are :</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Implementing the missing operations for object arrays</li>
<li>Implementing garbage collection support for object arrays (currently, storing an object inside an ndarray doesn't keep the object alive)</li>
<li>Packaging NumPyPy on PyPI</li>
</ul>
<div>
Cheers</div>
