      <p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/hrc706/pyrlang/overview">Pyrlang</a> is an Erlang BEAM bytecode interpreter written in RPython.</p>
<p>It implements approximately 25% of BEAM instructions. It can support
integer calculations (but not bigint), closures, exception handling,
some operators to atom, list and tuple, user modules, and multi-process
in single core. Pyrlang is still in development.</p>
<p>There are some differences between BEAM and the VM of PyPy:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>BEAM is a register-based VM, whereas the VM in PyPy is stack-based.</li>
<li>There is no traditional call-stack in BEAM. The Y register in BEAM is
similar to a call-stack, but the Y register can sometimes store some
variables.</li>
<li>There are no typical language-level threads and OS-level threads in
BEAM; only language-level processes, whose behavior is very similar
to the actor model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding bytecode dispatch loop, Pyrlang uses a while loop to fetch
instructions and operands, call the function corresponding to every
instruction, and jump back to the head of the while loop. Due to the
differences between the RPython call-stack and BEAM’s Y register, we
decided to implement and manage the Y register by hand. On the other
hand, PyPy uses RPython’s call stack to implement Python’s call stack.
As a result, the function for the dispatch loop in PyPy calls itself
recursively. This does not happen in Pyrlang.</p>
<p>The Erlang compiler (erlc) usually compiles the bytecode instructions
for function invocation into CALL (for normal invocation) and CALL_ONLY
(for tail recursive invocation). You can use a trampoline semantic to
implement it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CALL instruction: The VM pushes the current instruction pointer (or
called-program counter in PyPy) to the Y register, and jumps to the
destination label. When encountering a RETURN instruction, the VM
pops the instruction pointer from the Y register and returns to the
location of the instruction pointer to continue executing the outer
function.</li>
<li>CALL_ONLY instruction: The VM simply jumps to the destination label,
without any modification of the Y register. As a result, the tail
recursive invocation never increases the Y register.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current implementation only inserts the JIT hint of can_enter_jit
following the CALL_ONLY instruction. This means that the JIT only
traces the tail-recursive invocation in Erlang code, which has a very
similar semantic to the loop in imperative programming languages like
Python.</p>
<p>We have also written a single scheduler to implement the language level
process in a single core. There is a runable queue in the scheduler. On
each iteration, the scheduler pops one element (which is a process
object with dispatch loop) from the queue, and executes the dispatch
loop of the process object. In the dispatch loop, however, there is a
counter-call “reduction” inside the dispatch loop. The reduction
decrements during the execution of the loop, and when the reduction
becomes 0, the dispatch loop terminates. Then the scheduler pushes that
element into the runable queue again, and pops the next element for the
queue, and so on.</p>
<p>We are planning to implement a multi-process scheduler for multi-core
CPUs, which will require multiple schedulers and even multiple runable
queues for each core, but that will be another story. :-)</p>
<div class="section" id="methods">
<h2>Methods<a href="#methods" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We wrote two benchmark programs of Erlang:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>FACT: A benchmark to calculate the factorial in a tail-recursive
style, but because we haven’t implemented big int, we do a remainder
calculation to the argument for the next iteration, so the number
never overflows.</li>
<li>REVERSE: The benchmark creates a reversed list of numbers, such as
[20000, 19999, 19998, …], and applies a bubble sort to it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="the-value-of-reduction">
<h3>The Value of Reduction<a href="#the-value-of-reduction" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We used REVERSE to evaluate the JIT with different values of
reduction:</p>
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iAQtrDEcs7s/VOxUT54I7GI/AAAAAAAAF2Q/UdJt9stUKAY/s1600/reverse.png"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iAQtrDEcs7s/VOxUT54I7GI/AAAAAAAAF2Q/UdJt9stUKAY/s600/reverse.png"></a>
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GAOD7G7gdkU/VOxUTi19QeI/AAAAAAAAF2M/xXS3VXQwEwI/s1600/fact.png"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GAOD7G7gdkU/VOxUTi19QeI/AAAAAAAAF2M/xXS3VXQwEwI/s600/fact.png"></a>
<p>The X axis is the value of reduction, and the Y axis is the execution
time (by second).</p>
<p>It seems that when the value of reduction is small, the reduction
influences the performance significantly, but when reduction becomes
larger, it only increases the speed very slightly. In fact, we use 2000
as the default reduction value (as well as the reduction value in the
official Erlang interpreter).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the trace is always generated even when the reduction is
very small, such as 0, which means the dispatch loop can only run for a
very limited number of iterations, and the language level process
executes fewer instructions than an entire loop in one switch of the
scheduler). The generated trace is almost the same, regardless of
different reduction values.</p>
<p>Actually, the RPython JIT only cares what code it meets, but does not
care who executes it, thus the JIT always generates the results above.
The trace even can be shared among different threads if they execute the
same code.</p>
<p>The overhead at low reduction value may be due to the scheduler, which
switches from different processes too frequently, or from the
too-frequent switching between bytecode interpreter and native code, but
not from JIT itself.</p>
<p>Here is more explanation from Armin Rigo:</p>
<blockquote>
“The JIT works well because you’re using a scheme where some counter
is decremented (and the soft-thread interrupted when it reaches
zero) only once in each app-level loop. The soft-thread switch is
done by returning to some scheduler, which will resume a different
soft-thread by calling it. It means the JIT can still compile each
of the loops as usual, with the generated machine code containing
the decrease-and-check-for-zero operation which, when true, exits
the assembler."</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="fair-process-switching-vs-unfair-process-switching">
<h3>Fair Process Switching vs. Unfair Process Switching<a href="#fair-process-switching-vs-unfair-process-switching" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We are also concerned about the timing for decreasing reduction value.
In our initial version of Pyrlang, we decrease reduction value at every
local function invocation, module function invocation, and BIF (built-in
function) invocation, since this is what the official Erlang interpreter
does. However, since the JIT in RPython basically traces the target
language loop (which is the tail recursive invocation in Pyrlang) it is
typically better to keep the loop whole during a switch of the language
level process. We modified Pyrlang, and made the reduction decrement
only occur after CALL_ONLY, which is actually the loop boundary of the
target language.</p>
<p>Of course, this strategy may cause an “unfair” execution among language
level processes. For example, if one process has only a single
long-sequence code, it executes until the end of the code. On the other
hand, if a process has a very short loop, it may be executed by very
limited steps then be switched out by the scheduler. However, in the
real world, this “unfairness” is usually considered acceptable, and is
used in many VM implementations including PyPy for improving the overall
performance.</p>
<p>We compared these two versions of Pyrlang in the FACT benchmark. The
reduction decrement is quite different because there are some BIF
invocations inside the loop. In the old version the process can be
suspended at loop boundaries or other function invocation, but in the
new version, it can be suspended only at loop boundaries.</p>
<p>We show that the strategy is effective, removing around 7% of the
overhead. We have also compared it in REVERSE, but since there are no
extra invocations inside the trace, it cannot provide any performance
improvement. In the real world, we believe there is usually more than
one extra invocation inside a single loop, so this strategy is effective
for most cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comparison-with-default-erlang-and-hipe">
<h3>Comparison with Default Erlang and HiPE<a href="#comparison-with-default-erlang-and-hipe" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We compared the performance of Pyrlang with the default Erlang
interpreter and the HiPE (High Performance Erlang) complier. HiPE is an
official Erlang compiler that can compile Erlang source code to native
code. The speed of Erlang programs obviously improves but loses its
generality instead.</p>
<p>Please note that Pyrlang is still in development, so in some situations
it does less work than the default Erlang interpreter, such as not
checking integer overflow when dealing with big integer, and not
checking and adding locks when accessing message queues in the
language-level process, so is therefore faster. The final version of
Pyrlang may be slower.</p>
<p>We used the two benchmark programs above, and made sure both of them are
executed for more than five seconds to cover the JIT warm-up time for
RPython. The experiment environment is a OS X 10.10 machine with 3.5GHZ
6-core Intel Xeon E5 CPU and 14GB 1866 MHz DDR3 ECC memory.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the result of FACT. The graph shows that Pyrlang runs
177.41% faster on average than Erlang, and runs at almost the same speed
as HiPE. However, since we haven’t implemented big integer in Pyrlang,
the arithmetical operators do not do any extra overflow checking. It is
reasonable that the final version for Pyrlang will be slower than the
current version and HiPE.</p>
<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uWegj1T-Uqo/VOxU0q3i0vI/AAAAAAAAF2k/0fI1h0eUtuY/s1600/comparison.png"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uWegj1T-Uqo/VOxU0q3i0vI/AAAAAAAAF2k/0fI1h0eUtuY/s600/comparison.png"></a>
<p>As for REVERSE, the graph shows that Pyrlang runs 45.09% faster than
Erlang, but 63.45% slower than HiPE on average. We think this is
reasonable because there are only few arithmetical operators in this
benchmark so the speeds of these three implementations are closer.
However, we observed that at the scale of 40,000, the speed of Pyrlang
slowed down significantly (111.35% slower than HiPE) compared with the
other two scales (56.38% and 22.63% slower than HiPE).</p>
<p>Until now we can only hypothesize why Pyrlang slows down at that scale.
We guess that the overhead might be from GC. This is because the BEAM
bytecode provides some GC hints to help the default Erlang compiler to
perform some GC operations immediately. For example, using GC_BIF
instead of a BIF instruction tells the VM that there may be a GC
opportunity, and tells the VM how many live variables should be around
one instruction. In Pyrlang we do not use these kinds of hints but rely
on RPython’s GC totally. When there are a huge number of objects during
runtime, (as for REVERSE, it should be the Erlang list object) the speed
therefore slows down.</p>
