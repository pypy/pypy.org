PyPy 2.6.1</h1>
We’re pleased to announce PyPy 2.6.1, an update to PyPy 2.6.0 released June 1.
We have fixed many issues, updated stdlib to 2.7.10, <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org/">cffi</a> to version 1.3, extended support for
the new <a class="reference external" href="https://vmprof.readthedocs.org/">vmprof</a> statistical profiler for multiple threads, and increased
functionality of numpy.<br>
You can download the PyPy 2.6.1 release here:<br>

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project, and our volunteers and contributors.<br>
<br>
We would also like to encourage new people to join the project. PyPy has many
layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation
improvements, tweaking popular <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html#make-more-python-modules-pypy-friendly">modules</a> to run on pypy, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making
RPython’s JIT even better.<br><br>

<h2>
What is PyPy?</h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">pypy and cpython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
<br>
This release supports <b>x86</b> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, Windows 32, <a class="reference external" href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/lang/pypy">OpenBSD</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/lang/pypy/">freebsd</a>),
as well as newer <b>ARM</b> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux.<br>
<br>
We also welcome developers of other
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypyjs.org/">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython can do for them.</div>

<h2>
Highlights</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bug Fixes<ul>
<li>Revive non-SSE2 support</li>
<li>Fixes for detaching _io.Buffer*</li>
<li>On Windows, close (and flush) all open sockets on exiting</li>
<li>Drop support for ancient macOS v10.4 and before</li>
<li>Clear up contention in the garbage collector between trace-me-later and pinning</li>
<li>Issues reported with our previous release were <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/whatsnew-2.6.1.html">resolved</a> after reports from users on
our issue tracker at <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues">https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues</a> or on IRC at
#pypy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New features:<ul>
<li>cffi was updated to version 1.3</li>
<li>The python stdlib was updated to 2.7.10 from 2.7.9</li>
<li>vmprof now supports multiple threads and OS X</li>
<li>The translation process builds cffi import libraries for some stdlib
packages, which should prevent confusion when package.py is not used</li>
<li>better support for gdb debugging</li>
<li>freebsd should be able to translate PyPy “out of the box” with no patches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Numpy:<ul>
<li>Better support for record dtypes, including the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">align</span></code> keyword</li>
<li>Implement casting and create output arrays accordingly (still missing some corner cases)</li>
<li>Support creation of unicode ndarrays</li>
<li>Better support ndarray.flags</li>
<li>Support <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">axis</span></code> argument in more functions</li>
<li>Refactor array indexing to support ellipses</li>
<li>Allow the docstrings of built-in numpy objects to be set at run-time</li>
<li>Support the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buffered</span></code> nditer creation keyword</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Performance improvements:<ul>
<li>Delay recursive calls to make them non-recursive</li>
<li>Skip loop unrolling if it compiles too much code</li>
<li>Tweak the heapcache</li>
<li>Add a list strategy for lists that store both floats and 32-bit integers.
The latter are encoded as nonstandard NaNs.  Benchmarks show that the speed
of such lists is now very close to the speed of purely-int or purely-float
lists.</li>
<li>Simplify implementation of ffi.gc() to avoid most weakrefs</li>
<li>Massively improve the performance of map() with more than
one sequence argument</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Please try it out and let us know what you think. We welcome
success stories, <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2015/02/experiments-in-pyrlang-with-rpython.html">experiments</a>,  or <a class="reference external" href="https://mithrandi.net/blog/2015/03/axiom-benchmark-results-on-pypy-2-5-0">benchmarks</a>, we know you are using PyPy, please tell us about it!<br>
