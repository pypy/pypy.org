PyPy 2.5.1 - Pineapple Bromeliad</h2>
We’re pleased to announce PyPy 2.5.1, Pineapple <a class="reference external" href="https://xkcd.com/1498">Bromeliad</a> following on the heels of 2.5.0. You can download the PyPy 2.5.1 release here:<br>

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project, and for those who donate to our three sub-projects, as well as our
volunteers and contributors.
We’ve shown quite a bit of progress, but we’re slowly running out of funds.
Please consider donating more, or even better convince your employer to donate,
so we can finish those projects! The three sub-projects are:<br>

<ul>
<li>
<dl class="first docutils">
<dt><a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/py3donate.html">Py3k</a> (supporting Python 3.x): We have released a Python 3.2.5 compatible version we call PyPy3 2.4.0, and are working toward a Python 3.3 compatible version</dt>
<dt> </dt>
</dl>
</li>
<li><div class="first">
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/tmdonate2.html">STM</a> (software transactional memory): We have released a first working version,
and continue to try out new promising paths of achieving a fast multithreaded Python</div>
<div class="first">
<br></div>
</li>
<li><div class="first">
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/numpydonate.html">NumPy</a> which requires installation of our fork of upstream numpy,
available <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bitbucket.org/pypy/numpy">on bitbucket</a></div>
</li>
</ul>
We would also like to encourage new people to join the project. PyPy has many
layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">Rpython</a> documentation
improvements, tweaking popular <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html#make-more-python-modules-pypy-friendly">modules</a> to run on pypy, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making
Rpython’s JIT even better.<br><br>

<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
What is PyPy?</h3>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">pypy and cpython 2.7.x</a> performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>
<br>

This release supports <strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, Windows, and OpenBSD),
as well as newer <strong>ARM</strong> hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux.<br>

<br>
While we support 32 bit python on Windows, work on the native Windows 64
bit python is still stalling, we would welcome a volunteer
to <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/windows.html#what-is-missing-for-a-full-64-bit-translation">handle that</a>.<br><br>

Highlights</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The past months have seen pypy mature and grow, as rpython becomes the goto
solution for writing fast dynamic language interpreters. Our separation of
Rpython from the python interpreter PyPy is now much clearer in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/">PyPy documentation</a>  and we now have seperate <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython documentation</a>.
Tell us what still isn’t clear, or even better help us improve the documentation. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="highlights">
<ul class="simple" style="text-align: left;">
<li>We merged version 2.7.9 of python’s stdlib. From the python release notice:<ul>
<li>The entirety of Python 3.4’s <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html">ssl module</a> has been backported.
See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466">PEP 466</a> for justification.</li>
<li>HTTPS certificate validation using the system’s certificate store is now
enabled by default. See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0476">PEP 476</a> for details.</li>
<li>SSLv3 has been disabled by default in httplib and its reverse dependencies
due to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html">POODLE attack</a>.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/ensurepip.html">ensurepip module</a> has been backported, which provides the pip
package manager in every Python 2.7 installation. See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0477">PEP 477</a>.</li>
</ul>
<br>
</li>
<li>The garbage collector now ignores parts of the stack which did not change
since the last collection, another performance boost </li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple" style="text-align: left;">
<li>errno and LastError are saved around cffi calls so things like pdb will not
overwrite it </li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple" style="text-align: left;">
<li>We continue to asymptotically approach a score of 7 times faster than cpython
on our benchmark suite, we now rank 6.98 on latest runs </li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple" style="text-align: left;">
<li>Issues reported with our previous release were <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/whatsnew-2.5.1.html">resolved</a> after reports from users on
our issue tracker at <a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues">https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues</a> or on IRC at
#pypy.</li>
</ul>
Please try it out and let us know what you think. We welcome
success stories, <a class="reference external" href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2015/02/experiments-in-pyrlang-with-rpython.html">experiments</a>,  or <a class="reference external" href="https://mithrandi.net/blog/2015/03/axiom-benchmark-results-on-pypy-2-5-0">benchmarks</a>, we know you are using PyPy, please tell us about it!<br>

Cheers<br>
