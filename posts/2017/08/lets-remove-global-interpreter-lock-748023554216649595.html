<p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>The Python community has been discussing removing the Global Interpreter Lock for
a long time.
There have been various attempts at removing it:
Jython or IronPython successfully removed it with the help of the underlying
platform, and some have yet to bear fruit, like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/larryhastings/gilectomy">gilectomy</a>. Since our <a class="reference external" href="/posts/2017/03/leysin-winter-sprint-summary-4587213628578490701.html">February sprint</a> in Leysin,
we have experimented with the topic of GIL removal in the PyPy project.
We believe that the work done in IronPython or Jython can be reproduced with
only a bit more effort in PyPy. Compared to that, removing the GIL in CPython is a much
harder topic, since it also requires tackling the problem of multi-threaded reference
counting. See the section below for further details.</p>
<p>As we announced at EuroPython, what we have so far is a GIL-less PyPy
which can run <strong>very simple</strong> multi-threaded, nicely parallelized, programs.
At the moment, more complicated programs probably segfault. The
remaining 90% (and another 90%) of work is with putting locks in strategic
places so PyPy does not segfault during concurrent accesses to
data structures.</p>
<p>Since such work would complicate the PyPy code base and our day-to-day work,
we would like to judge the interest of the community and the commercial
partners to make it happen (we are not looking for individual
donations at this point).  We estimate a total cost of $50k,
out of which we already have backing for about 1/3 (with a possible 1/3
extra from the STM money, see below).  This would give us a good
shot at delivering a good proof-of-concept working PyPy with no GIL. If we can get a $100k
contract, we will deliver a fully working PyPy interpreter with no GIL as a release,
possibly separate from the default PyPy release.</p>
<p>People asked several questions, so I'll try to answer the technical parts
here.</p>
<h3>What would the plan entail?</h3>
<p>We've already done the work on the Garbage Collector to allow doing multi-
threaded programs in RPython.  "All" that is left is adding locks on mutable
data structures everywhere in the PyPy codebase. Since it would significantly complicate
our workflow, we require real interest in that topic, backed up by
commercial contracts in order to justify the added maintenance burden.</p>
<h3>Why did the STM effort not work out?</h3>
<p>STM was a research project that proved that the idea is possible. However,
the amount of user effort that is required to make programs run in a
parallelizable way is significant, and we never managed to develop tools
that would help in doing so.  At the moment we're not sure if more work
spent on tooling would improve the situation or if the whole idea is really doomed.
The approach also ended up adding significant overhead on single threaded programs,
so in the end it is very easy to make your programs slower.  (We have some money
left in the donation pot for STM which we are not using; according to the rules, we
could declare the STM attempt failed and channel that money towards the present
GIL removal proposal.)</p>
<h3>Wouldn't subinterpreters be a better idea?</h3>
<p>Python is a very mutable language - there are tons of mutable state and
basic objects (classes, functions,...) that are compile-time in other
language but runtime and fully mutable in Python.  In the end, sharing
things between subinterpreters would be restricted to basic immutable
data structures, which defeats the point. Subinterpreters suffers from the same problems as
multiprocessing with no additional benefits.
We believe that reducing mutability to implement subinterpreters is not viable without seriously impacting the
semantics of the language (a conclusion which applies to many other
approaches too).</p>
<h3>Why is it easier to do in PyPy than CPython?</h3>
<p>Removing the GIL in CPython has two problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>how do we guard access to mutable  data structures with locks and</li>
<li>what to do with reference counting that needs to be guarded.</li>
</ul>
<p>PyPy only has the former problem; the latter doesn't exist,
due to a different garbage collector approach.  Of course the first problem
is a mess too, but at least we are already half-way there. Compared to Jython
or IronPython, PyPy lacks some data structures that are provided by JVM or .NET,
which we would need to implement, hence the problem is a little harder
than on an existing multithreaded platform. However, there is good research
and we know how that problem can be solved.</p>
