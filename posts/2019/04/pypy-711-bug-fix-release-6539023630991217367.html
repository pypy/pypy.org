The PyPy team is proud to release a bug-fix release version 7.1.1 of PyPy, which
includes two different interpreters:<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.</li>
<li>PyPy3.6-beta: the second official release of PyPy to support 3.6
features.</li>
</ul>

The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the double
release.<br>

<br>
This bugfix fixes bugs related to large lists, dictionaries, and sets, some corner cases with unicode, and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/">PEP 3118</a> memory views of ctype structures. It also fixes a few issues related to the ARM 32-bit backend. For the complete list see the <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/release-v7.1.1.html">changelog.</a><br>
<br>
You can download the v7.1.1 releases here:<br>

<br>
As always, this release is 100% compatible with the previous one and fixed
several issues and bugs raised by the growing community of PyPy users.
We strongly recommend updating.<br>
<br>
The PyPy3.6 release is rapidly maturing, but is still considered beta-quality.<br>
