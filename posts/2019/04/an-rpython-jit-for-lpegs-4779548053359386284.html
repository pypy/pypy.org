<html><body><p>The following is a guest post by Stefan Troost, he describes the work he did in his bachelor thesis:</p>

<p>In this project we have used the RPython infrastructure to generate an RPython
JIT for a
less-typical use-case: string pattern matching. The work in this project is
based on <a href="bford.info/pub/lang/peg.pdf">Parsing Expression Grammars</a> and
<a href="www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/docs/peg.pdf">LPeg</a>, an implementation of PEGs
designed to be used in Lua. In this post I will showcase some of the work that
went into this project, explain PEGs in general and LPeg in particular, and
show some benchmarking results.</p>
<h1><a id="Parsing_Expression_Grammars_12"></a>Parsing Expression Grammars</h1>
<p>Parsing Expression Grammas (PEGs) are a type of formal grammar similar to
context-free grammars, with the main difference being that they are unambiguous.
This is achieved by redefining the ambiguous choice operator of CFGs (usually
noted as <code>|</code>) as an <em>ordered</em> choice operator. In practice this means that if a
rule in a PEG presents a choice, a PEG parser should prioritize the leftmost
choice. Practical uses include parsing and pattern-searching. In comparison to
regular expressions PEGs stand out as being able to be parsed in linear time,
being strictly more powerful than REs, as well as being arguably more readable.</p>
<h1><a id="LPeg_24"></a>LPeg</h1>
<p>LPeg is an implementation of PEGs written in C to be used in the Lua
programming language. A crucial detail of this implementation is that it parses
high level function calls, translating them to bytecode, and interpreting that
bytecode. Therefore, we are able to improve that implementation by replacing
LPegs C-interpreter with an RPython JIT. I use a modified version of LPeg to
parse PEGs and pass the generated Intermediate Representation, the LPeg
bytecode, to my VM.</p>
<h1><a id="The_LPeg_Library_35"></a>The LPeg Library</h1>
<p>The LPeg Interpreter executes bytecodes created by parsing a string of commands
using the LPeg library. Our JIT supports a subset of the LPeg library, with
some of the more advanced or obscure features being left out. Note that this
subset is still powerful enough to do things like parse JSON.</p>

<p>As a simple example, the pattern <code>lpeg.P"ab"+lpeg.P"cd"</code> would match either the
string <code>ab</code> or the string <code>cd</code>.</p>

<p>These patterns are translated into bytecode by LPeg, at which point we are able
to pass them into our own VM.</p>
<h1><a id="The_VM_73"></a>The VM</h1>
<p>The state of the VM at any point is defined by the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PC</code>: program counter indicating the current instruction</li>
<li><code>fail</code>: an indicator that some match failed and the VM must backtrack</li>
<li><code>index</code>: counter indicating the current character of the input string</li>
<li><code>stackentries</code>: stack of return addresses and choice points</li>
<li><code>captures</code>: stack of capture objects</li>
</ul>
<p>The execution of bytecode manipulates the values of these variables in order to
produce some output. How that works and what that output looks like will be
explained now.</p>
<h1><a id="The_Bytecode_88"></a>The Bytecode</h1>
<p>For simplicity’s sake I will not go over every individual bytecode, but instead
choose some that exemplify the core concepts of the bytecode set.</p>
<h2><a id="generic_character_matching_bytecodes_93"></a>generic character matching bytecodes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>any</code>: Checks if there’s any characters left in the inputstring. If it succeeds
it advances the index and PC by 1, if not the bytecode fails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>char c</code>: Checks if there is another bytecode in the input and if that
character is equal to <code>c</code>. Otherwise the bytecode fails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>set c1-c2</code>: Checks if there is another bytecode in the input and if that
character is between (including) c1 and c2. Otherwise the bytecode fails.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These bytecodes are the easiest to understand with very little impact on the
VM. What it means for a bytecode to fail will be explained when
we get to control flow bytecodes.</p>
<p>To get back to the example, the first half of the pattern <code>lpeg.P"ab"</code> could be
compiled to the following bytecodes:</p>
<pre><code>char a
char b
</code></pre>
<h2><a id="control_flow_bytecodes_117"></a>control flow bytecodes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>jmp n</code>: Sets <code>PC</code> to <code>n</code>, effectively jumping to the n’th bytecode. Has no defined
failure case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>testchar c n</code>: This is a lookahead bytecode. If the current character is equal
to <code>c</code> it advances the <code>PC</code> but not the index. Otherwise it jumps to <code>n</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>call n</code>: Puts a return address (the current <code>PC + 1</code>) on the <code>stackentries</code> stack
and sets the <code>PC</code> to <code>n</code>. Has no defined failure case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ret</code>: Opposite of <code>call</code>. Removes the top value of the <code>stackentries</code> stack (if
the string of bytecodes is valid this will always be a return address) and
sets the <code>PC</code> to the removed value. Has no defined failure case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>choice n</code>: Puts a choice point on the <code>stackentries</code> stack. Has no defined
failure case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>commit n</code>: Removes the top value of the <code>stackentries</code> stack (if the string of
bytecodes is valid this will always be a choice point) and jumps to <code>n</code>. Has no
defined failure case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <code>testchar</code> we can implement the full pattern <code>lpeg.P"ab"+lpeg.P"cd"</code> with
bytecode as follows:</p>
<pre><code>testchar a -&gt; L1
any
char b
end
any
L1: char c
char d
end
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>any</code> bytecode is needed because <code>testchar</code> does not consume a character
from the input.</p>
<h2><a id="Failure_Handling_Backtracking_and_Choice_Points_158"></a>Failure Handling, Backtracking and Choice Points</h2>
<p>A choice point consist of the VM’s current <code>index</code> and <code>capturestack</code> as well as a
<code>PC</code>. This is not the VM’s <code>PC</code> at the time of creating the
choicepoint, but rather the <code>PC</code> where we should continue trying to find
matches when a failure occurs later.</p>
<p>Now that we have talked about choice points, we can talk about how the VM
behaves in the fail state. If the VM is in the fail state, it removed entries
from the stackentries stack until it finds a choice point. Then it backtracks
by restoring the VM to the state defined by the choice point. If no choice
point is found this way, no match was found in the string and the VM halts.</p>
<p>Using choice points we could implement the example <code>lpeg.P"ab" + lpeg.P"cd"</code> in
bytecodes in a different way (LPEG uses the simpler way shown above, but for
more complex patterns it can’t use the lookahead solution using <code>testchar</code>):</p>
<pre><code>choice L1
char a
char b
commit
end
L1: char c
char d
end
</code></pre>
<h2><a id="Captures_188"></a>Captures</h2>
<p>Some patterns require the VM to produce more output than just “the pattern
matched” or “the pattern did not match”. Imagine searching a document for an
IPv4 address and all your program responded was “I found one”. In order to
recieve additional information about our inputstring, captures are used.</p>
<h3><a id="The_capture_object_195"></a>The capture object</h3>
<p>In my VM, two types of capture objects are supported, one of them being the
position capture. It consists of a single index referencing the point in the
inputstring where the object was created.</p>
<p>The other type of capture object is called simplecapture. It consists of an
index and a size value, which are used to reference a substring of the
inputstring. In addition, simplecaptures have a variable status indicating they
are either open or full. If a simplecapture object is open, that means that its
size is not yet determined, since the pattern we are capturing is of variable
length.</p>
<p>Capture objects are created using the following bytecodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Fullcapture Position</code>: Pushes a positioncapture object with the current index
value to the capture stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Fullcapture Simple n</code>: Pushes a simplecapture object with current index value
and size=n to the capture stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Opencapture Simple</code>: Pushes an open simplecapture object with current index
value and undetermined size to the capture stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>closecapture</code>: Sets the top element of the capturestack to full and sets its
size value using the difference between the current index and the index of
the capture object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a id="The_RPython_Implementation_224"></a>The RPython Implementation</h1>
<p>These, and many more bytecodes were implemented in an RPython-interpreter.
By adding jit hints, we were able to generate an efficient JIT.
We will now take a closer look at some implementations of bytecodes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">...
        <span class="hljs-keyword">elif</span> instruction.name == <span class="hljs-string">"any"</span>:
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> index &gt;= len(inputstring):
                fail = <span class="hljs-keyword">True</span>
            <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
                pc += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
                index += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>

...
</code></pre>
<p>The code for the <code>any</code>-bytecode is relatively straight-forward. It either
advances the <code>pc</code> and <code>index</code> or sets the VM into the fail state,
depending on whether the end of the inputstring has been reached or not.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">...
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> instruction.name == <span class="hljs-string">"char"</span>:
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> index &gt;= len(inputstring):
                fail = <span class="hljs-keyword">True</span>
            <span class="hljs-keyword">elif</span> instruction.character == inputstring[index]:
                pc += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
                index += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
            <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
                fail = <span class="hljs-keyword">True</span>
...
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>char</code>-bytecode also looks as one would expect. If the VM’s string index is
out of range or the character comparison fails, the VM is put into the
fail state, otherwise the <code>pc</code> and <code>index</code> are advanced by 1. As you can see, the
character we’re comparing the current inputstring to is stored in the
instruction object (note that this code-example has been simplified for
clarity, since the actual implementation includes a jit-optimization that
allows the VM to execute multiple successive char-bytecodes at once).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">...
        <span class="hljs-keyword">elif</span> instruction.name == <span class="hljs-string">"jmp"</span>:
            pc = instruction.goto
...
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>jmp</code>-bytecode comes with a <code>goto</code> value which is a <code>pc</code> that we want
execution to continue at.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">...
        <span class="hljs-keyword">elif</span> instruction.name == <span class="hljs-string">"choice"</span>:
            pc += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
            choice_points = choice_points.push_choice_point(
                instruction.goto, index, captures)
...
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see here, the <code>choice</code>-bytecode puts a choice point onto the stack that
may be backtracked to if the VM is in the fail-state. This choice point
consists of a pc to jump to which is determined by the bytecode.
But it also includes the current <code>index</code> and <code>captures</code> values at the time the choice
point was created. An ongoing topic of jit optimization is which data structure
is best suited to store choice points and return addresses. Besides naive
implementations of stacks and single-linked lists, more case-specific
structures are also being tested for performance.</p>
<h1><a id="Benchmarking_Result_299"></a>Benchmarking Result</h1>
<p>In order to find out how much it helps to JIT LPeg patterns we ran a small
number of benchmarks. We used an otherwise idle Intel Core i5-2430M CPU with
3072 KiB of cache and 8 GiB of RAM, running with 2.40GHz. The machine was
running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Lua 5.2.3 and we used GNU grep 2.16 as a point of
comparison for one of the benchmarks. The benchmarks were run 100 times in
a new process each. We measured the full runtime of the called process,
including starting the process.</p>
<p>Now we will take a look at some plots generated by measuring the runtime of
different iterations of my JIT compared to lua and using bootstrapping to
generate a sampling distribution of mean values. The plots contain a few different
variants of pypeg, only the one called "fullops" is important for this blog post, however.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qv3aZapdMOk/XKXMDhTGujI/AAAAAAAAsNo/b7QShypeeV8mvePwTjPgmDSzUVB6EsiaACLcBGAs/s1600/rawplot_100_kb_urlinput.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qv3aZapdMOk/XKXMDhTGujI/AAAAAAAAsNo/b7QShypeeV8mvePwTjPgmDSzUVB6EsiaACLcBGAs/s400/rawplot_100_kb_urlinput.png" width="400"></a></div>

<p>This is the plot for a search pattern that searches a text file for valid URLs.
As we can see, if the input file is as small as 100 kb, the benefits of JIT
optimizations do not outweigh the time required to generate the
machine code. As a result, all of our attempts perform significantly slower
than LPeg.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mTry3w1vSFA/XKXMNoaeHOI/AAAAAAAAsNs/YhdGWoGmyjU3yxqFgcePBklGv-qw13wXgCLcBGAs/s1600/rawplot_500_kb_urlinput.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mTry3w1vSFA/XKXMNoaeHOI/AAAAAAAAsNs/YhdGWoGmyjU3yxqFgcePBklGv-qw13wXgCLcBGAs/s400/rawplot_500_kb_urlinput.png" width="400"></a></div>

<p>This is the plot for the same search pattern on a larger input file. As we can
see, for input files as small as 500 kb our VM already outperforms LPeg’s. An
ongoing goal of continued development is to get this lower boundary as small as
possible.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Cr4BE9Cejg8/XKXMUXamP3I/AAAAAAAAsN0/t5PTo0Q4vPMLwL12bdQ93Q4bAMIjJTEVACLcBGAs/s1600/rawplot_5_mb_urlinput.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Cr4BE9Cejg8/XKXMUXamP3I/AAAAAAAAsN0/t5PTo0Q4vPMLwL12bdQ93Q4bAMIjJTEVACLcBGAs/s400/rawplot_5_mb_urlinput.png" width="400"></a></div>

<p>The benefits of a JIT compared to an Interpreter become more and more relevant
for larger input files. Searching a file as large as 5 MB makes this fairly
obvious and is exactly the behavior we expect.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uIoguDb7ApE/XKXMngYEnSI/AAAAAAAAsOA/zdv2WAfdRwwruS1yOdX7jFz0nB_PPQqRACLcBGAs/s1600/rawplot_50_kb_jsoninput.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uIoguDb7ApE/XKXMngYEnSI/AAAAAAAAsOA/zdv2WAfdRwwruS1yOdX7jFz0nB_PPQqRACLcBGAs/s400/rawplot_50_kb_jsoninput.png" width="400"></a></div>

<p>This time we are looking at a different more complicated pattern, one that parses JSON used on a
50 kb input file. As expected, LPeg outperforms us, however, something
unexpected happens as we increase the filesize.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r1-Aq39Oe9I/XKXMuQlcB6I/AAAAAAAAsOE/Eqmj7i3JKz0zdTK6Cd1ai11aZCf-EZkVwCLcBGAs/s1600/rawplot_100_kb_jsoninput.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r1-Aq39Oe9I/XKXMuQlcB6I/AAAAAAAAsOE/Eqmj7i3JKz0zdTK6Cd1ai11aZCf-EZkVwCLcBGAs/s400/rawplot_100_kb_jsoninput.png" width="400"></a></div>

<p>Since LPeg has a defined maximum depth of 400 for the choicepoints and
returnaddresses Stack, LPeg by default refuses to parse files as small as
100kb. This raises the question if LPeg was intended to be used for parsing.
Until a way to increase LPeg’s maximum stack depth is found, no comparisons to
LPeg can be performed at this scale. This has been a low priority in the past
but may be addressed in the future.</p>
<p>To conclude, we see that at sufficiently high filesizes, our JIT outperforms
the native LPeg-interpreter. This lower boundary is currently as low as 100kb
in filesize.</p>
<h1><a id="Conclusion_353"></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Writing a JIT for PEG’s has proven itself to be a challenge worth pursuing, as
the expected benefits of a JIT compared to an Interpreter have been achieved.
Future goals include getting LPeg to be able to use parsing patterns on larger
files, further increasing the performance of our JIT and comparing it to other
well-known programs serving a similar purpose, like grep.</p>
<p>The prototype implementation that I described in this post can be found
<a href="https://github.com/sktroost/PyPeg/tree/master/pypeg">on Github</a>
(it's a bit of a hack in some places, though).</p></body></html>
