The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.1.0 of PyPy, which includes
two different interpreters:<br>

<blockquote>
<div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7</li>
<li>PyPy3.6-beta: this is the second official release of PyPy to support 3.6
features, although it is still considered beta quality.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the double
release.<br>

<br>
This release, coming fast on the heels of 7.0 in February, finally merges the
internal refactoring of unicode representation as UTF-8. Removing the
conversions from strings to unicode internally lead to a nice speed bump. We merged the utf-8 changes to the py3.5 branch (Python3.5.3) but will concentrate on 3.6 going forward.<br>

<br>
We also improved the ability to use the buffer protocol with ctype structures
and arrays.<br>

<br>
The <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/">CFFI</a> backend has been updated to version 1.12.2. We recommend using CFFI
rather than c-extensions to interact with C, and <a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/">cppyy</a> for interacting with
C++ code.<br>

We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
direct consulting work.<br>

<br>
We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/index.html">PyPy</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org/">RPython</a> documentation improvements, tweaking popular modules to run
on pypy, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/project-ideas.html">help</a> with making RPython’s JIT even better.<br>

<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: x-large;">What is PyPy?</span></h2>
PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7, 3.6. It’s fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org/">PyPy and CPython 2.7.x</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.<br>

<br>
We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.<br>

This PyPy release supports:<br>
<strong> </strong></div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-pypy">
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS X 64 bits, Windows 32 bits, OpenBSD, FreeBSD)</li>
<li>big- and little-endian variants of <strong>PPC64</strong> running Linux</li>
<li> <b>ARM32 </b>although we do not supply downloadable binaries at this time</li>
<li><strong>s390x</strong> running Linux</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="changelog">
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: x-large;">What else is new?</span></h2>
PyPy 7.0 was released in February, 2019.
There are many incremental improvements to RPython and PyPy, for more information see the <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/release-v7.1.0.html#changelog">changelog</a>.<br>
<br>
Please update, and continue to help us make PyPy better.<br>
