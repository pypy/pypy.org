.. description: Breaking down why Sphinx is slow
.. type: text

PyPy has an extensive benchmark suite. On most of the microbenchmarks we do
quite well. One of the more complete benchmarks is one that builds a sphinx
document website based on the CPython2 documentation. The benchmark takes ~175
seconds on PyPy3 without the JIT and ~80 seconds with the JIT on the
benchmarking machine, CPython finishes the benchmark in about 45 seconds. This
is a good opportunity to explore how to analyze PyPy’ performance and suggest
paths forward to speed it up.

.. TEASER_END

The problem is to find out what exactly is going on, where the slowdowns
are. Ususally, you need to combine cprofile and JIT profiling. A typical
workflow is to use cprofile with CPython and PyPy to get a deterministic
call tree. Then use vmprof for a sampling profiler, and use the JIT log
for the actual Jitted code.

Running the benchmark
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is how to run the benchmark in a posix shell:

::

    hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/benchmarks
    cd benchmarks
    rm -rf lib/cpython-doc/build
    PYTHONPATH=lib:lib/jinja2/ <python> \
    lib/cpython-doc/tools/sphinx-build.py -b html \
    -d lib/cpython-doc/build/doctrees lib/cpython-doc/ \
    lib/cpython-doc/build/html

Since we want the benchmark to run consistently over many versions of
python, all the third-party packages are part of the benchmark repo:
``docutils``, ``sphinx``, and of course the source documentation itself.
So we use ``PYTHONPATH`` to run the benchmark. Replace ``<python>`` with
the version of python you wish to benchmark. To run PyPy without the
JIT, use ``<pypy> --jit off``. This post targets PyPy3.8-v7.3.10.

Getting started: ``cprofile``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OK, now we know how to run the benchmark, but we aer looking for places
PyPy could do better. One way to profile is to use the built-in
``cprofile`` module. We can write the output to a file. However, any
deterministic profiler will slow down the program being profiled
considerably, so this is best used for a rought measure of performance.
We can run the command above, but instead of ``<python>``, use
``<python> -m cprofile -o <outfile>``.

Pickle
^^^^^^

The output from a CPython run and a PyPy run can be diffed. That quickly
pointed to ``write_tree`` as a place where something is off: CPython
runs it in ~1 sec and PyPy takes ~44 secs. Sphinx uses pickle underneath
to save intermediary results. CPython has the ``_pickle`` c-extension
module built in, PyPy uses a pure-python implementation. So some of this
slowdown may be due to cprofile overhead on the python code. We know
pickling dictionaries is 8x slower on PyPy, but 44x is a bit extreme. So
if PyPy had a faster pickle implementation that would make many things
faster. A nice task for someone who wants to learn about RPython might
be to transpile the ``_pickle.c`` code (or the pure-python parts of
``pickle.py`` that ``_pickle.c`` reimplements), add tests and make it
fast.

docutils
^^^^^^^^

Another easy comparison is in the ``docutils`` (a pure-python library)
``nodes._fast_traverse`` functions. PyPy takes 70s on where CPython
needs ~18. ``_fast_traverse`` is a six-line function:

::

        def _fast_traverse(self, cls):
            """Specialized traverse() that only supports instance checks."""
            result = []
            if isinstance(self, cls):
                result.append(self)
            for child in self.children:
                result.extend(child._fast_traverse(cls))
            return result

It does a check, appends to a list, then recurses, and returns the list.
Recursion is slow on both CPython and PyPy: rewriting this as a
non-recursive function would be a clear win. But this benchmark is now
fixed in time. We could add a new benchmark with the changed code, that
would not help with this one.

Next step: the JIT log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we know a bit more about the performance bottlenecks, let's
dive into what is going on inside the JIT. We can run the command above
a little differently in order to create a log of the JIT activity:

``PYPYLOG=jit-log-opt,jit-summary,jit-backend-counts:out-sphinx PYTHONPATH=lib:lib/jinja2/ ~/bin/pypy lib/cpython-doc/tools/sphinx-build.py -b html lib/cpython-doc/ lib/cpython-doc/build/ -E``

The ``PYPYLOG`` value saves only some of the JIT information. Like
``cprofile``, writing this information out slows down the JIT.

The last section of the log (backend-counts) summarizes counts of the
bridges and loops, so you can see which are the "busiest" loops. You
search for the target token (the address of the loop)

Just before that is the jit-summary. It can tell you the time spent
tracing and in the backend. That is about 15% in our case.

One other hack is to sort the ``debug_merge_points`` by function name:

``grep debug_merge_point out-sphinx | cut -d ' ' -f 3-9 | sort | uniq -c | sort --numeric-sort``

We made way too many versions of ``_fast_traverse``, and it is
recursive. This is because it makes bridges (failed guard calling out to
other code). So in the log there is a ``# bridge ...`` comment, it has
an address. We found one that points to the guard on the loop call,
generating a new version for each combination of ``type(self)`` and
``type(cls)``. This is silly, most of the calls to ``_fast_travserse``
will create such a bridge.

Aside: why is there a jit code ``ll_listcontains...`` ? This always
happens when looking at a trace: you find things that drag you down a
rabbit hole.

One approach to solving this would be "give up": do not create another
guard/bridge for each specialization. Another solution: check the depth
of the chain of bridges and do something if it is too deep. We need to
be careful not to, for instance, make translation slower.

In order to create a test for this in the JIT, we would need to recreate
it in a test. We would need a simple class implementation with a
function that looks like ``_fast_traverse``, and a class generator
factory that would create the classes in a way that approximately
recreates the sphinx situation.
