title: 2nd Call for donations - Transactional Memory in PyPy

==============================
Transactional Memory, 2nd Call
==============================


This is the second call for donations on the topic of Transactional
Memory (TM) in PyPy, a way to run CPU-hungry Python programs in
multithreaded mode.  It is a follow-up on our `first call for
donations`_ from two years ago.  At that time, we suggested a
single-threaded slow-down of somewhere between 2x and 5x.  The aim that
seems now within reach is rather closer to 1.25x, i.e.  running only 25%
slower than the regular PyPy.

We achieved – or overachieved – most goals laid out in the first call by
a large margin, while at the same time raising only about half the
money.  The result of this first step is `described in the documentation
of PyPy`__.

The present proposal is about development of the second half: starting
from the various missing low-level optimizations, it will most
importantly focus on developing the Python-facing interface.  This
includes both internal things (e.g. do dictionaries need to be more
TM-friendly in general?) as well as directly visible things (e.g. some
profiler-like interface to explore common conflicts in a program).  It
also includes exploring and tweaking some existing libraries to improve
their TM-friendliness (e.g. Twisted and Stackless).

Introduction
============

In the presence of today's machines with multiple processors, Python
progress is lagging behind: on any CPU-constrained program, developers
have a difficult choice to make.  They can use in-process solutions that
do not offer multi-CPU usage.  In this respect, the natural choice
nowadays is to use Twisted or other event-based paradigms, or systems
that hide events in the control flow, like Stackless; or alternatively,
they can use the existing ``threading`` module, with its associated GIL
and the complexities of real multi-threaded programming (locks,
deadlocks, races, etc.), which make this solution less attractive.  The
most attractive alternative for most developers is to rely on one of various multi-process
solutions that are outside the scope of the core Python language. All of them require a
major restructuring of the program and often need extreme care and extra
knowledge to use them.

We propose an implemention of
Transactional Memory in PyPy.  This is a technique that recently came to
the forefront of the multi-core scene.  It promises to offer multi-core CPU
usage in a single process.
In particular, by modifying the core of the event systems
mentioned above, we will enable the use of multiple cores, without the
user needing to use explicitly the ``threading`` module.

The first proposal was launched near the start of 2012 and has covered
much of the fundamental research, up to the point of getting a first
version of PyPy working in a very roughly reasonable state (after
collecting about USD$27'000, which is little more than half of the money
that was sought; hence the present second call for donations).

We now propose fixing the remaining issues to obtaining a
really good GIL-free PyPy (described in `goal 1`_ below). We
will then focus on the various new features needed to actually use multiple
cores without explicitly using multithreading (`goal 2`_ below), up to
and including adapting some existing framework libraries, for
example Twisted, Tornado, Stackless, or gevent (`goal 3`_ below).



In more detail
==============

This is a call for financial help in implementing a version of PyPy able
to use multiple processors in a single process, called PyPy-TM; and
developing the APIs and libraries needed as well as enhancing commonly
available frameworks to use the new feature.  The developers will be
Armin Rigo and Remi Meier and possibly others.

We currently estimate the final performance goal to be a slow-down of
25% to 40% from the current non-TM PyPy; i.e. running a fully serial application would take between
1.25 and 1.40x the time it takes in a regular PyPy.  This goal has
been reached already in some cases, but we need to make this result more
broadly applicable.  We feel confident that we can reach this goal more
generally: the performance of PyPy-TM running any suitable
application should scale linearly or close-to-linearly with the number
of processors.  This means that starting with two cores, such
applications should perform better than a non-TM PyPy.  (All numbers
presented here are comparing different versions of PyPy which all have
the JIT enabled.  A "suitable application" is one without many conflicts;
see `goal 2`_.)

You will find below a sketch of the `work plan`_.  We start with a Q&A.


What is the Global Interpreter Lock?
------------------------------------

The GIL, or Global Interpreter Lock, is a single lock in both CPython
and the regular PyPy.  Every thread must acquire it in order to execute
Python bytecodes.  This means that both with CPython and with the
regular PyPy, Python programs do not gain any benefit in term of
multicore performance even if they are using threads.


What is Transactional Memory?
-----------------------------

`Transactional Memory`_ (TM) is a technique imported from
databases: every time we want to do a change to the processors' main
memory, we do it in a "transaction".  Multiple transactions can be
executed in parallel by multiple cores.  When a transaction is complete,
we try to commit it.  This might either succeed, or (if another
transaction committed incompatible changes) fail.  If it fails, which is
hopefully rare, we need to restart the transaction from scratch.

Transactional Memory research has progressed a lot since two years ago,
notably with the introduction of Intel's Haswell_ processors, which
offer Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM).  We discuss below why we
think HTM is, so far, still not suitable for our goals.

.. _`Transactional Memory`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory
.. _Haswell: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29


.. _`update on HTM`:

Hardware vs Software Transactional Memory
-----------------------------------------

The idea of Transactional Memory was recently made popular by Intel's
Haswell_ processor (released in 2013).  We could replace most of the
Software Transactional Memory (STM) library currently used inside PyPy
with a much smaller Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) library based on
hardware features and running on Haswell-generation processors.  This
has been attempted by Remi Meier recently.  However, it seems that it
fails to scale as we would expect it to: the current generation of HTM
processors is limited to run small-scale transactions.  Even the default
transaction size used in PyPy-STM is often too much for HTM; and
reducing this size increases overhead without completely solving the
problem.  Based on this experience, it seems safe to say that right now
HTM-enabled processors lack the support that we need.

Future processors might improve on various aspects.  We are particularly
interested in `Virtualizing Transactional Memory`_, a 2005 paper that
describes the limits that we're running into and how to solve them more
generally.  A CPU with support for the virtual memory described in this
paper would certainly be better for running PyPy-HTM.

Another issue in HTM is sub-cache-line false conflicts (conflicts caused by two
independent objects that happens to live in the same cache line, which
is usually 64 bytes).  This is in contrast with the current PyPy-STM,
which doesn't have false conflicts of this kind at all and might thus be
ultimately better for very-long-running transactions.  We are not aware of
published research discussing issues of sub-cache-line false conflicts.

Note that right now PyPy-STM has false conflicts within the same object,
e.g. within a list or a dictionary; but we can easily do something
about it (see `goal 2_`).  Also, it might be possible in PyPy-HTM to
arrange objects in memory ahead of time so that such conflicts are very
rare; but we will never get a rate of exactly 0%, which might be
required for very-long-running transactions.

Why do TM with PyPy instead of CPython?
---------------------------------------

While there have been early experiments on Hardware Transactional Memory
with CPython (`Riley and Zilles (2006)`__, `Tabba (2010)`__), there has
been none in the past few years.  To the best of our knowledge,
the closest is an attempt using `Haswell on the
Ruby interpreter`__.  None of these attempts tries to do the same using
Software Transactional Memory.  We would nowadays consider it possible
to adapt our stmgc-c7 library for CPython, but it would be a lot of
work, starting from changing the reference-counting garbage collection scheme.  PyPy is
better designed to be open to this kind of research.

However, the best argument from an objective point of view is probably
that PyPy has already implemented a Just-in-Time compiler.  It is thus
starting from a better position in terms of performance, particularly
for the long-running kind of programs that we target here.

Alternatives
------------

PyPy-TM will be slower than judicious usage of existing alternatives,
based on multiple processes that communicate with each other in one way
or another.  The counter-argument is that TM is not only a cleaner
solution: there are cases in which it is not really possible to organize (or
retrofit) an existing program into the particular format needed for the
alternatives.  In particular, small quickly-written programs don't need
the additional baggage of cross-process communication; and large
programs can sometimes be almost impossible to turn into multi-process
versions.  By contrast, we believe that TM can fit naturally into most
programs, because it only requires local changes to some dispatcher; the
rest of the program should work without changes.


Platforms other than the x86-64 Linux
-------------------------------------

The current solution depends on having a
huge address space available.  Porting to any 32-bit
architecture would quickly run into the limitation of a 2GB or 4GB of address space.
The way TM works right now would further divide this
limit by N+1, where N is the number of segments.  It might be possible
to create partially different memory views for multiple threads that
each access the same range of addresses; but this would likely require
changes inside the OS.  We didn't investigate so far.

The current 64-bit version relies
heavily on Linux- and clang-only features.  We believe it is a suitable
restriction: a lot of multi- and many-core servers commonly available
are nowadays x86-64 machines running Linux.  Nevertheless, non-Linux
solutions appear to be possible as well.  OS/X (and likely the various
BSDs) seems to handle ``mmap()`` better than Linux does, and can remap
individual pages of an existing mapping to various pages without hitting
a limit of 65536 like Linux.  Windows might also have a solution, although we
didn't measure yet; but first we would need a 64-bit Windows PyPy, which has
not seen much active support.

We will likely explore the OS/X path (as well as the Windows path if Win64
support grows in PyPy), but this is not part of this current
donation proposal.

It might be possible to adapt the work done on x86-64 to the 64-bit
ARMv8 as well. We have not investigated this so far.

Work plan
=========

This is an very rough estimate of the amount of work it would take to
complete the steps for an experienced developer who is already familiar
with the PyPy codebase.  As before, we cannot guarantee the time
estimates here, but we do agree to report regularly to the community, so
our progress can be followed publicly.  We currently expect the duration
of the whole project to be up to two years starting from April 2014.

Paid work will be at $60/hour, but at least one developer who will work
on the project – Armin Rigo – has committed to one hour of volunteer
work per paid hour; and another developer – Remi Meier – is a Ph.D. student
and gets paid from another source already.  The total amount of money
that we ask below corresponds roughly to one half-time job.

A 10% general donation will go to the `Software Freedom
Conservancy`_ itself, the non-profit organization of which the PyPy
project is a member and which manages all the issues related to
donations, payments, and tax-exempt status.
An extra fraction of the money collected will be entered into the
general PyPy pot, used for example to finance sprint travel costs to
students.  This fraction is 10% maximum, unless more money than
requested is collected, in which case the whole excess will go to
the general PyPy pot.

**Note** For donations higher than $1,000, we can arrange for an invoice
and a different payment method to avoid the high Paypal fees.  Please
contact pypy at sfconservancy.org if you want to know details on how
to donate via other means.

Goal 1
------

The PyPy-TM that we have in the end of March 2014 is good enough in
some cases to run existing multithreaded code without a GIL, but not in
all of them.  There are a number of caveats for the user and missing
optimizations.  The goal #1 is to improve this case and address
the caveats.  The current status is written down `in the docs`__ and
will evolve over time.

.. __: https://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/stm.html

For future reference, at the end of March the main identified issues
are:

* There are still a number of bugs.

* The JIT warm-up time is abysmal.

* The GC is missing a number of optimizations that are present in
  a regular PyPy.

* Destructors are not supported (``__del__()`` methods).

* The STM bookkeeping logic could see more improvements.

* Forking the process is slow.

* We don't foresee particularly high conflict rates in regular
  multithreaded programs, but this assertion needs to be checked
  and possibly some heuristics improved.

Fixing all these issues is required before we can confidently say that
PyPy-TM is an out-of-the-box replacement of a regular PyPy which gives
speed-ups over the regular PyPy independently of the Python program it
runs, as long as it is using at least two threads.


Goal 2
------

This goal contains the various new features needed to use multiple cores
without explicitly using multithreading; in other words, the new APIs
and libraries accessible from Python programs that want to make use of
this benefit.

This goal requires good support for very-long-running transactions,
started with the ``with atomic`` construct documented here__.  This
approach hides the notion of threads from the end programmer, including
all the hard multithreading-related issues.  This is not the first
alternative approach to explicit threads; for example, OpenMP_ is one.
However, it is one of the first ones which does not require the code to
be organized in a particular fashion.  Instead, it works on any Python
program which has got latent, imperfect parallelism.  Ideally, it only
requires that the end programmer identifies where this parallelism is
likely to be found, and communicates it to the system, using some
lightweight library on top of ``with atomic``.

However, this introduces new issues.  The main one is that by forcing
transactions to be longer, "conflicts" will become more common, up to
the point of partially or completely offsetting the benefit of using
PyPy-TM in the first place.

So the programmer using PyPy-TM needs a way to get
feedback about what conflicts we get in these long-running transactions,
and where they are produced.  A first step will be to implement getting
"tracebacks" that point to the places where the most time is lost.  This
could be later integrated into some "profiler"-like variant where we can
navigate the conflicts, either in a live program or based on data logs.

Some of these conflicts can be solved by improving PyPy-TM directly.
The system works on the granularity of objects and doesn't generate
false conflicts, but some conflicts may be regarded as "false" anyway:
these involve most importantly the built-in dictionary type, for which
we would like accesses and writes using independent keys to be truly
independent.  Other built-in data structures have a similar issue, like
lists: ideally, writes to different indexes should not cause conflicts;
but more generally, we would need a mechanism, possibly under the
control of the application, to do things like append an item to a list
in a "delayed" manner, to avoid conflicts.

.. __: https://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/stm.html
.. _OpenMP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP

Similarly, we might need a way to delay some I/O: doing it only at the
end of the transaction rather than immediately, in order to prevent the
whole transaction from turning inevitable.

The goal 2 is thus the development of tools to inspect and fix the
causes of conflicts, as well as fixing the ones that are apparent inside
PyPy-TM directly.


Goal 3
------

The third goal is to look at some existing event-based frameworks (for
example Twisted, Tornado, Stackless, gevent, ...) and attempt to make
them use threads and atomic sections internally.  We would appreciate
help and feedback from people more involved in these frameworks, of
course.

The idea is to apply the techniques described in the `goal 2`_ until we
get a version of framework X which can transparently parallelize the
dispatching and execution of multiple events.  This might require some slight
reorganization of the core in order to split the I/O and the actual
logic into separate transactions.


Funding
-------

We forecast that goal 1 and a good chunk of goal 2 should be reached in
around 6 months of work.  The remaining parts of goal 2 as well as goal
3 are likely to be more open-ended jobs.  We will go with a total
estimate of two years in order to get a final, well-tested PyPy-STM with
stable performance.  The amount sought by this fundraising campaign is
USD$80'000, corresponding to one half-time job for 16 months (1200 hours
at $60/hour plus 10% overhead).


Benefits of This Work to the Python Community and the General Public
====================================================================

Python has become one of the most popular dynamic programming languages in
the world.  Web developers, educators, and scientific programmers alike
all value Python because Python code is often more readable and because
Python often increases programmer productivity.

Traditionally, languages like Python ran more slowly than static, compiled
languages; Python developers chose to sacrifice execution speed for ease
of programming.  The PyPy project created a substantially improved Python
language implementation, including a fast Just-in-time (JIT) compiler.
The increased execution speed that PyPy provides has attracted many users,
who now find their Python code runs between 2 and 50 times faster under PyPy
than under the reference implementation written in C.

However, in the presence of today's machines with multiple processors,
Python progress lags behind.  The issue has been described in the
introduction: developers that really need to use multiple CPUs are
constrained to select and use one of the multi-process solutions that
are all in some way or another hacks requiring extra knowledge and
efforts to use.  The focus of the work described in this proposal is to
offer an alternative in the core of the Python language — an
alternative that can naturally integrate with the rest of the program.
This alternative is implemented in PyPy.

PyPy's developers make all PyPy software available to the public without
charge, under PyPy's Open Source copyright license, the permissive MIT
License.  PyPy's license assures that PyPy is equally available to
everyone freely on terms that allow both non-commercial and commercial
activity.  This license allows for academics, for-profit software
developers, volunteers and enthusiasts alike to collaborate together to
make a better Python implementation for everyone.

PyPy-TM is and continues to be available under the same license.  Being
licensed freely to the general public means that opportunities to use,
improve and learn about how Transactional Memory works itself will be
generally available to everyone.
